<h1>Chapter 6: Truth: Above the Ruins</h1>
<h2>Section 1: Conversation at the Transit Station</h2>
<p>The white light faded.</p>
<p>No familiar bedroom. No relaxed feeling after taking off a VR helmet.</p>
<p>Lin Yi found himself still lying on the ground, but the surface beneath him was no longer cold rough cement. It was a warm, glass-like material.</p>
<p>He looked up in confusion.</p>
<p>This was a pure white space.</p>
<p>No boundaries, no ceiling, no direction. Up, down, left, right—all endless white. So white it made him feel dizzy and lonely.</p>
<p>"Is this... the place after completing the mission?"</p>
<p>Lin Yi rolled over and lay spread-eagle on the ground, gasping for air.</p>
<p>The severe pain in his ribs was gone. The wounds on his palms had disappeared. Even that suffocating feeling of near-death had vanished.</p>
<p>But he still didn't want to move. The exhausted feeling of surviving a disaster flooded over him like a tide.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Sample 17."</p>
<p>That emotionless mechanical synthesized voice sounded again, echoing in this empty space with a divine authority.</p>
<p>Lin Yi sat up suddenly. His eyes were fierce like a frightened wild animal, looking around.</p>
<p>"Who?! Come out!"</p>
<p>"What is this place? I want to go home! I'm not playing anymore! Let me go back!"</p>
<p>He screamed hysterically in that pure white space, venting his accumulated fear and anger.</p>
<p>"This is illegal detention! This is intentional harm! I'm calling the police!"</p>
<p>"This is the [Transit Station]."</p>
<p>As the voice fell, countless light points gathered in front of Lin Yi, gradually forming a blurry human outline. It glowed all over. Its face couldn't be seen clearly. Only the eye positions flickered with blue data streams.</p>
<p>"I am your Observer, and also your instructor."</p>
<p>The light figure floated in mid-air, looking down at Lin Yi from above.</p>
<p>"What you just completed was only the 1-star entry test codenamed 'Abandoned School.'"</p>
<p>"1-star? Entry?"</p>
<p>Lin Yi sounded like he'd heard the biggest joke ever. He pointed at his own nose. His voice trembled with anger. "You call that entry? I died twice! I was bitten to death, torn apart twice! That pain... that despair... you call this entry?!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The Observer's voice remained coldly calm. "According to database statistics, samples average 4.5 deaths in their first trial. 30% of samples are forcibly erased after mental breakdown. Your performance is above average."</p>
<p>"Erased..." Lin Yi caught that word. His face went pale. "Mental points reaching zero really means death?"</p>
<p>"In this space, death is the only currency." The Observer said flatly. "You pay with pain to earn the right to survive."</p>
<p>Lin Yi collapsed on the ground, holding his head in his hands.</p>
<p>"Crazy... you're all crazy..."</p>
<p>"Want to see why we do this?"</p>
<p>The Observer suddenly waved its hand.</p>
<h2>Section 2: Hell 50 Years Later</h2>
<p>The surrounding pure white space suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>In its place was a holographic projection of a starry sky. A blue planet floated in front of Lin Yi—it was Earth.</p>
<p>But as the view zoomed in, Lin Yi's pupils shrank violently.</p>
<p>This wasn't the Earth he knew.</p>
<p>The atmosphere showed a sickly gray-yellow color. Huge cyclones raged over the oceans. On the land masses, the once brilliant city lights had gone out, replaced by large areas of scorched black and ruins.</p>
<p>The camera continued zooming in, landing on a once-prosperous super city.</p>
<p>Skyscrapers had become broken walls, covered by wildly growing mutant plants. Huge monsters roamed the streets—creatures hundreds, thousands of times more terrifying than the zombies he'd seen at the school.</p>
<p>There were humans.</p>
<p>But those humans were no longer Earth's masters. They hid in underground shelters like rats, wearing rags, thin and starving, killing each other over half a moldy piece of bread.</p>
<p>"What is this? A CG movie?" Lin Yi's voice trembled.</p>
<p>"This is the future."</p>
<p>The Observer's voice became low and solemn. "To be precise, this is Earth 50 years from now."</p>
<p>"The Great Filter mechanism activated. Alien civilization invasion? Virus outbreak? AI out of control? The cause doesn't matter."</p>
<p>"What matters is the result: human civilization collapsed in 48 hours. Our proud technology, laws, morals—worthless in the face of absolute power."</p>
<p>"This is your ending. Surviving in ruins until the last person dies."</p>
<p>Lin Yi stared blankly at that hellish scene.</p>
<p>The visual impact was too strong—so strong he forgot to argue.</p>
<p>"What... does this have to do with me?"</p>
<p>"Because of genes."</p>
<p>The scene changed. A complex double helix structure appeared. Among countless blue base pairs, a section glowing golden-red was flashing.</p>
<p>"We screened millions of qualified people worldwide. Inside your bodies sleeps an ancient recessive gene called <strong>[Rebirth]</strong>."</p>
<p>The Observer pointed at that red sequence.</p>
<p>"The [Rebirth] gene is the key to human evolution. It gives hosts the ability to adapt quickly in desperate situations and break through limits at death's edge. But it needs 'fear' and 'pain' as nutrients to awaken."</p>
<p>"So..." Lin Yi murmured. "You created this trial system? To... train us?"</p>
<p>"No, to select warriors."</p>
<p>The Observer walked in front of Lin Yi. Those blue eyes stared directly at his soul.</p>
<p>"Lin Yi, this isn't just a game. This is to preserve humanity's last spark when that day comes."</p>
<p>"All the pain you experienced, every drop of blood you shed, is to teach you how to survive in that hell."</p>
<p>"What if I refuse?" Lin Yi looked up, his eyes complex. "This is too heavy. I'm just an ordinary person. I don't want to be a savior."</p>
<p>"You can choose to quit."</p>
<p>The Observer didn't force him. "We'll erase all your memories about the trial and send you back to reality. You can continue going to school, dating, working—living your stable, ordinary but happy life."</p>
<p>"Until 50 years later, when disaster strikes."</p>
<p>"On that day, you'll die like those billions of ordinary people in the first wave of impact, without any resistance. You won't even know how you died."</p>
<p>"Or..."</p>
<p>The Observer extended its hand, pointing at countless light gates appearing in the void ahead.</p>
<p>"You choose to continue. With your memories, with your pain, entering the next mission."</p>
<p>"It will hurt. It will be desperate. You will die many times."</p>
<p>"But when your [Rebirth] gene unlock rate reaches 100%, you will have the power to rewrite the future."</p>
<p>Lin Yi fell silent.</p>
<p>He looked at his undamaged hands. They seemed to still carry the rust smell from climbing the drainpipe.</p>
<p>His mind flashed with his parents' smiling faces, flashed with that peaceful real world.</p>
<p>But it also flashed with the ruined Earth he just saw, flashed with that child killed over half a piece of bread.</p>
<p>Was he scared?</p>
<p>Scared to death.</p>
<p>But could he go back to being that carefree "expert player"?</p>
<p>After he'd seen the real abyss?</p>
<p>A long time passed.</p>
<p>Lin Yi slowly stood up from the ground. His legs were still trembling slightly, but his back was straight.</p>
<p>At that moment, the confusion in his eyes disappeared, replaced by a cold hardness forged through fire.</p>
<p>"If I choose to quit, those two deaths just now... would be wasted, right?" Lin Yi asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Yes. Completely meaningless."</p>
<p>"I don't like losing deals."</p>
<p>Lin Yi took a deep breath. A bleak but firm smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. "Besides, now that I know the future will become like that... I can't pretend to sleep anymore."</p>
<p>He raised his head and looked directly at the Observer.</p>
<p>"I choose to continue."</p>
<p>"Wise choice."</p>
<p>The light around the Observer brightened greatly, seeming to show a hint of satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Rest for 24 hours (1 hour real time). You can use the points you earned to exchange for supplies."</p>
<p>"Next trial—2-star mission: <strong>[Lightless Hospital]</strong>."</p>
<p>"Hint: In that hospital, what you can't see is often more deadly than what you can see."</p>
<p>Lin Yi clenched his fists.</p>
<p>No longer an ignorant player, but a warrior who had glimpsed the abyss and was ready to challenge it.</p>
<p>"Bring it on."</p>
