<h1>Chapter 5: Survival Instinct</h1>
<h2>Section 1: Think Like a Rat</h2>
<p>The third time he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Lin Yi didn't jump up like the first two times. He didn't check his body either.</p>
<p>He lay curled up in the dusty corner like a real corpse, arms wrapped tightly around his knees, body shaking violently.</p>
<p>His teeth chattered, making "clack clack" sounds.</p>
<p>The phantom pain of being torn apart, chewed up, and beaten to death was like a fog that wouldn't go away. It covered every inch of his nerves.</p>
<p>Even though he wasn't injured now, he felt like his whole body was in pain.</p>
<p><em>Buzz.</em></p>
<p>The system interface popped up again. The bright red countdown was like a death sentence: <strong>29:58</strong>.</p>
<p>"I can't do this... I really can't..."</p>
<p>Lin Yi buried his face in his knees. Tears flowed down uncontrollably, mixing with the dust on his face and turning into dirty mud.</p>
<p>"What stupid trial... what stupid rebirth... I'm just a college student... I want to go home..."</p>
<p>Fear.</p>
<p>Complete, overwhelming fear crushed all his pride.</p>
<p>The first two deaths made him understand a cruel fact: in front of those constantly evolving monsters, his proud "gaming skills" and "memory advantage" were as ridiculous as a baby's toy sword.</p>
<p>He only had 100 mental points. Now only 70 remained.</p>
<p>A few more deaths and he would be erased. Really disappear.</p>
<p>"I'm going to die... I'm really going to die here..."</p>
<p>Time passed second by second.</p>
<p>5 minutes went by.</p>
<p>Lin Yi still huddled in the corner, not daring to move a step.</p>
<p>Just then, a wind blew past, rolling up waste paper on the ground.</p>
<p>The paper tumbled, revealing a line of small text underneath—it was a piece of old newspaper on the classroom floor with half a blurry headline:</p>
<p><em>"...to survive is the only truth..."</em></p>
<p>Lin Yi stared at those words through his tears.</p>
<p>Survive.</p>
<p>"Victory condition: Survive 30 minutes."</p>
<p>This system message suddenly exploded in his mind.</p>
<p>Lin Yi's head shot up. His eyes showed confusion, then gradually turned into a kind of crazy clarity.</p>
<p>"Survive... yes, the mission is to survive!"</p>
<p>"The system never said to kill monsters! Never said to clear the map! Never said to find a safe room!"</p>
<p>His two previous deaths were because he treated himself as the "main character," as the "hunter." He actively looked for weapons, actively set traps, actively provoked those monsters.</p>
<p>This was typical <strong>gamer thinking</strong>—killing enemies gives experience, offense is the best defense.</p>
<p>"But in reality... in real wilderness survival, when facing predators many times stronger, what should the weak do?"</p>
<p>Lin Yi looked at the gray sky outside the window and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>"Antelopes don't attack lions. Mice don't provoke cats."</p>
<p>"They run. They hide. They hide themselves in the dirtiest, most inconspicuous corners. Even if they hold their breath until they suffocate, they survive."</p>
<p>To survive, you can't be a hero.</p>
<p>You have to be a rat.</p>
<p>You have to be the most humble, most sneaky, most inconspicuous rat in the gutter.</p>
<p>Lin Yi wiped away his tears. His eyes changed.</p>
<p>No longer that flashy confidence, and not complete breakdown either. Instead, it was... a beast-like alertness and humility.</p>
<p>He slowly stood up. The first thing he did was take off his sneakers.</p>
<p>The soles were soft, but in hallways full of gravel and glass shards, they would still make noise.</p>
<p>He wore only socks, stepping on the ice-cold cement floor. Glass shards stabbed his feet, but he gritted his teeth and didn't make a sound.</p>
<p>Then he looked at the fire axe.</p>
<p>It was a symbol of power, a source of security.</p>
<p>But he turned away without hesitation, not even looking at it again.</p>
<p>"Too heavy. Too loud. Carrying it, I'll have the idea to 'fight back.' And once I want to fight back, I'm close to death."</p>
<p>Lin Yi, barefoot, like a ghost, silently pressed against the wall and slipped out of the classroom.</p>
<h2>Section 2: Game in the Gutter</h2>
<p>This time, Lin Yi didn't use the hallway.</p>
<p>He used collapsed walls and broken window frames between classrooms to move through the rooms.</p>
<p>Every time he passed a doorway, he would lie on the ground and press his ear to the floor for dozens of seconds. After confirming there was no movement outside, he would crawl across quickly like a gecko.</p>
<p>The red dots on the virtual map were moving.</p>
<p>The zombies were searching. They were evolving.</p>
<p>They were probably wondering why that arrogant prey didn't appear at the stairway this time. Why was there no sound?</p>
<p>"Keep looking... you won't find me."</p>
<p>Lin Yi crawled into a girls' bathroom.</p>
<p>This was forbidden territory in all horror games, but in Lin Yi's eyes, there was a perfect hiding place here—the ventilation duct.</p>
<p>He stood on the toilet lid and struggled to remove the louvers from the vent. The rusty screws cut his fingers. Blood seeped out.</p>
<p>Lin Yi immediately put his bleeding finger in his mouth and sucked hard, not letting the bloody smell spread.</p>
<p>Because he remembered that the zombies in the first mission had very sensitive smell.</p>
<p>He crawled into the narrow, dark duct full of dust and spider webs.</p>
<p>The space was extremely small, barely enough for one person to crawl. People with claustrophobia would go crazy here, but Lin Yi felt an unprecedented sense of security.</p>
<p>He put the louvers back and stared through the gaps at the bathroom below.</p>
<p>Time passed.</p>
<p><strong>15 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>A rush of messy footsteps charged into the bathroom.</p>
<p>Three zombies.</p>
<p>They held weapons and paced around the bathroom anxiously. They smelled a living person (probably from the blood Lin Yi spilled earlier), but couldn't find the source.</p>
<p>One zombie even lay on the ground, checking the gaps under the stall doors.</p>
<p>Another smashed the bathroom mirror with a steel pipe, venting its anger at not finding prey.</p>
<p>Lin Yi lay in the duct two meters above their heads. He even stopped breathing.</p>
<p>A spider crawled across his cheek. The fuzzy feeling made him itch like crazy, but he stayed still as a statue, not even blinking.</p>
<p>He counted silently in his mind.</p>
<p><em>One second, two seconds, three seconds...</em></p>
<p>The zombies found nothing and left with roars.</p>
<p>Only after the footsteps completely disappeared did Lin Yi let out a long breath. He was almost completely exhausted.</p>
<p>"This is survival..."</p>
<p>No fancy combos. No satisfying headshots.</p>
<p>Only enduring loneliness, fear, and filth in the darkness, surviving like an insect.</p>
<p>But this wasn't shameful. Because he was still alive.</p>
<p><strong>25 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Lin Yi had to move.</p>
<p>The system seemed to be forcing him out by releasing a toxic green gas into the duct.</p>
<p>"Forcing me out?"</p>
<p>Lin Yi crawled out from the exit at the end of the third floor. This was the back of the school building.</p>
<p>At this moment, all the zombies in the campus seemed to riot. They lost patience and started a carpet search.</p>
<p>The hallways were full of roars. Red dots densely converged on the third floor.</p>
<p>"I'm surrounded."</p>
<p>Lin Yi looked at the terrain.</p>
<p>The only way out was through the window.</p>
<p>But outside the window was only a rusty cast iron drainpipe attached to the wall.</p>
<p>Below was cement ground more than ten meters high. Falling would mean certain death.</p>
<p>Behind him were zombies breaking through the door. Staying would mean certain death.</p>
<p>"I'll risk it!"</p>
<p>Lin Yi climbed out the window. His whole body hung in the air. His hands desperately hugged that rough pipe.</p>
<p>The rough rust instantly scraped the skin off his palms. Piercing pain came through.</p>
<p>"Hiss—"</p>
<p>Lin Yi gritted his teeth, not daring to make a sound.</p>
<p>He moved down bit by bit like a sloth.</p>
<p>Just then, a rotting head poked out from the window above.</p>
<p>A zombie found him!</p>
<p>It stretched out its thin arm, trying to grab Lin Yi's hair.</p>
<p>Its fingertips scraped past Lin Yi's scalp, pulling out a few strands of hair.</p>
<p>Lin Yi's heart stopped. If he let go now, he would be smashed to pulp.</p>
<p>But he didn't panic.</p>
<p>Because he discovered that although this zombie had evolved, it seemed afraid to climb this vertical pipe. It anxiously slapped the wall on the windowsill, helplessly raging.</p>
<p>"You're scared too?"</p>
<p>A hint of vengeful pleasure rose in Lin Yi's heart. He endured the severe pain and sped up his descent.</p>
<p>When he slid to the second floor, his arms were so sore they were losing feeling. His palms were covered in blood.</p>
<p>But he saw an open window on the second floor.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, pushed off the wall with his feet, and swung.</p>
<p>His whole body flew toward that window like a pendulum.</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>He crashed heavily into the second-floor storage room. In that instant, he felt like two of his ribs might have broken.</p>
<p>The severe pain made his vision go black, but he didn't even groan. He immediately crawled on all fours under a pile of abandoned desks and covered himself with some rags.</p>
<p><strong>29 minutes 30 seconds.</strong></p>
<p>Dense footsteps came from the stairs. The zombie horde was coming downstairs. They knew the prey was on the second floor.</p>
<p>The footsteps approached the storage room.</p>
<p>The door was smashed open.</p>
<p>The stench of rot spread.</p>
<p>A foot stopped in front of the desk where Lin Yi was hiding.</p>
<p>Through the gaps in the rags, Lin Yi could see those torn sneakers and the black sticky liquid dripping on the ground.</p>
<p>If it bent down.</p>
<p>If it lifted this cloth.</p>
<p>Everything would be over.</p>
<p>Lin Yi's eyes were wide open. His hand tightly gripped a piece of glass he'd found on the ground.</p>
<p>If discovered, he would stab the enemy's eye without hesitation—or stab his own carotid artery.</p>
<p>Compared to being bitten to death, suicide might be the last dignity.</p>
<p>"3..."</p>
<p>"2..."</p>
<p>"1..."</p>
<p>The countdown on Lin Yi's retina reached zero.</p>
<p>The moment the zombie bent down, a holy white light suddenly burst out and swallowed the entire world.</p>
