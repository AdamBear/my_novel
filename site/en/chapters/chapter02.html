<h1>Chapter 2: Perfect Strategy</h1>
<h2>Section 1: First Kill</h2>
<p>The air in the hallway was colder than in the classroom. It felt like it could freeze your bones.</p>
<p>Both walls were covered with stains and scratch marks. A sign that should have said "Study Hard Every Day" was now only half there, splattered with dark brown liquid.</p>
<p>Lin Yi didn't rush out. As an experienced gamer, he knew the saying "sharpen your axe before cutting wood."</p>
<p>"Find a weapon first. That's rule number one in survival games."</p>
<p>His eyes scanned the hallway quickly. A broken mop handle? Too weak. Scattered bricks? Too short range.</p>
<p>Finally, his eyes locked on a fire extinguisher box nearby.</p>
<p>The glass door was half broken. The fire hose was gone, but that didn't matter. What mattered was the red-handled silver fire axe hanging on the side of the red box.</p>
<p>"Bingo."</p>
<p>Lin Yi walked over quickly, grabbed the axe handle, and pulled hard.</p>
<p>"Whoa! So heavy!"</p>
<p>Lin Yi's wrist dropped. He almost couldn't hold it. This axe was much heavier than the light models he'd used in other games. The heavy weight reminded him again how hardcore this game's physics engine was.</p>
<p>He held it with both hands and swung it a few times.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh—whoosh—</em></p>
<p>The axe blade cut through the air, making a deep sound. The momentum made his body lean forward slightly. This real force feedback made him feel very confident.</p>
<p>"Attack power: three out of five stars. Slow attack speed, but heavy and powerful. Definitely good armor-breaking effect." Lin Yi gave the weapon his own rating in his head.</p>
<p>Just then, noise came from the stairway.</p>
<p>The dragging footsteps got closer and closer, along with a teeth-grinding low growl.</p>
<p>Lin Yi gripped the axe tight, pressed his back against the wall, held his breath, and hid at the corner of the hallway. He tried to use third-person view... oh wait, this game was first-person. He could only use the corner's shadow to hide himself.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, a figure stumbled out from the stairway.</p>
<p>It was a "student" wearing torn school uniform.</p>
<p>Or rather, it used to be a student.</p>
<p>Half its face was gone, showing white cheekbones and dark red gums. One eyeball hung outside the eye socket, swinging as it walked. The uniform was covered with dirty blood and organ pieces, giving off a suffocating stench.</p>
<p>"Ugh..."</p>
<p>Even though he was mentally prepared, the smell of rotting corpse almost made Lin Yi throw up.</p>
<p>"This smell is too strong! It's realistic, but this is just VR. If you really met something like this, the smell alone could kill you."</p>
<p>The zombie seemed to smell a living person. Its aimless movements suddenly stopped. It turned its head sharply. Its remaining eye stared at where Lin Yi was hiding. A roar came from its throat.</p>
<p><em>ROAR!!!</em></p>
<p>"It found me."</p>
<p>Lin Yi didn't panic. He watched the zombie stumble toward him—calling it a charge was generous. It was only slightly faster than a normal person walking.</p>
<p>"Slow movement speed, stiff movements, no ranged attacks."</p>
<p>Lin Yi made his judgment instantly.</p>
<p>He didn't even back up. He stood in place, quietly waiting for the zombie to enter attack range.</p>
<p>5 meters.</p>
<p>3 meters.</p>
<p>2 meters.</p>
<p>The zombie opened its arms, showing a mouth full of black teeth, and lunged at Lin Yi.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lin Yi moved.</p>
<p>He didn't fight head-on. Instead, he slid to the left, smoothly dodging the zombie's clumsy lunge. The zombie missed and stumbled forward from momentum, completely exposing its rotting back of the head to Lin Yi.</p>
<p>"Weak spot!"</p>
<p>Lin Yi's eyes focused. He raised the fire axe with both hands and chopped down with all his strength.</p>
<p><em>Splat! Crack!</em></p>
<p>The sound was so realistic it was creepy.</p>
<p>The wet sound of the blade cutting into flesh, then the crisp sound of splitting the skull. Red and white stuff instantly splattered out, spraying all over Lin Yi.</p>
<p>The zombie didn't even scream. It collapsed like a pile of mud, twitched twice, and stopped moving.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the body started breaking apart, turning into countless blue data streams that disappeared into the air. Only a pool of blood remained on the ground.</p>
<p>【Kill Record】</p>
<p>Target: Zombie Student</p>
<p>Experience Points: +10</p>
<p>Rating: Weak Point Critical Hit</p>
<p>"Phew..." Lin Yi wiped the blood spots from his face (though they quickly turned into data and disappeared too). His heart was pounding hard, but not from fear—from excitement.</p>
<p>"This feeling of cutting into flesh is amazing!"</p>
<p>He swung the axe, his confidence soaring.</p>
<p>"With monsters at this level, I could kill ten of them easily."</p>
<h2>Section 2: Arrogant Performance</h2>
<p>The successful first kill made Lin Yi completely relax. He started treating this like a real "speed-run performance."</p>
<p>He opened the system's built-in 【Recording Function】.</p>
<p>"Since this is beta testing, I should definitely record a video to show off on the forums."</p>
<p>Lin Yi cleared his throat and started his performance for the invisible camera.</p>
<p>"Ahem, hello everyone, I'm your old friend Lin Yi. Today I'm bringing you live footage from the first beta test of 'Infinite Trial.'"</p>
<p>"As you can see, this game's graphics are unbeatable. That zombie's model just now—the details are explosive."</p>
<p>He explained to the air while walking through the hallway with his axe, swaggering.</p>
<p>"For this kind of beginner mission, the core strategy has three points: find weapons, use terrain, hit weak spots."</p>
<p>On the second floor, Lin Yi met two zombies.</p>
<p>He didn't panic. Instead, he pointed at the narrow hallway ahead and said, "Watch carefully. The terrain ahead is narrow. We're going to use this 'bottleneck.'"</p>
<p>He deliberately made noise to attract the zombies, then backed into the gap between two rows of desks.</p>
<p>The two zombies squeezed together. Their collision volumes got stuck on each other. They could only wave their arms in helpless rage. Lin Yi stood at a safe distance and took them out one axe swing at a time, like playing whack-a-mole.</p>
<p>"This is called crushing them with intelligence." Lin Yi whistled proudly. "This game's AI is still too dumb. They only walk in straight lines. They don't know how to flank."</p>
<p>After clearing the second floor, Lin Yi opened the map. His eyes locked on a special marker on the third floor—【Library】.</p>
<p>The map showed the library was a separate room with only one entrance and very small windows.</p>
<p>"Brothers, here's the important part." Lin Yi pointed at the map to explain. "In survival games, when you don't want to clear enemies, the best method is to find an easy-to-defend stronghold and hide. This library is the perfect 'safe room.'"</p>
<p>He looked at the countdown.</p>
<p>"Still 15 minutes left. I don't want to waste energy on this tutorial level. My strategy now is: enter the library, lock the door, then wait idle until I win."</p>
<p>Lin Yi carried his axe, humming a tune, and went up the stairs back to the third floor.</p>
<p>He jogged to the library door. It was a heavy double wooden door that looked very solid.</p>
<p>He pushed the door open. A strong smell of moldy books hit his face. The library was dark inside. Rows of tall bookshelves stood like silent tombstones.</p>
<p>Lin Yi walked in and quickly checked around.</p>
<p>No zombies. Only one exit. A few small high windows that were impossible to reach.</p>
<p>"Perfect."</p>
<p>He closed the door hard and locked it tight. To be extra safe, he struggled to push over two heavy bookshelves full of books and blocked the door completely.</p>
<p>"Now it's secure. Forget zombies—even a tank couldn't break through."</p>
<p>Lin Yi dusted off his hands, found a comfortable chair to sit in, and put his feet up on the table.</p>
<p>"This is what I call a textbook-level strategy. Beginner friends, did you learn it?"</p>
<p>He watched the countdown tick away, feeling completely relaxed.</p>
<p>At this moment, he was completely immersed in his own "expert player script." He thought he was the hunter in control, playing with stupid prey.</p>
<p>However, he didn't notice something.</p>
<p>The moment he entered the library, in the shadows at the end of the hallway, a pair of eyes—no longer empty, glowing with a cold light—were staring at that closed door.</p>
<p>In those eyes, there was no confusion, no chaos.</p>
<p>Only a chilling, cold calculation.</p>
<p><em>[Observation Record - Sample 17]</em></p>
<p><em>Time: 15 minutes 00 seconds after mission start</em></p>
<p><em>Status: Extremely arrogant, alertness at lowest level.</em></p>
<p><em>Observer Notes:</em></p>
<p><em>This is humanity's most tragic flaw. They always use past experience to measure unknown dangers. He thinks that once he finds the pattern, he can control everything.</em></p>
<p><em>But he forgot that in this trial, the only unchanging rule is "evolution."</em></p>
<p><em>Warning: AI intelligence level has jumped. Sample behavior pattern detected as simple. Enemy unit "Tracker" has activated learning module.</em></p>
<p><em>The real show is just beginning.</em></p>
