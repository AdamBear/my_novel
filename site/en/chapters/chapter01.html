<h1>Chapter 1: Game Start</h1>
<h2>Section 1: Too Real to Be a "Game"</h2>
<p>When Lin Yi woke up, his throat felt like someone had stuffed rusty iron sand into it.</p>
<p>He gasped for air. The old, moldy smell mixed with lime powder rushed into his lungs. He coughed hard.</p>
<p>"Cough, cough, cough... What the..."</p>
<p>Lin Yi scrambled up from the floor, hitting his chest while looking around in surprise.</p>
<p>Above him was a ceiling that looked like peeling dead skin. White paint fell off in big chunks, showing the gray-black concrete underneath, like a rotting face. In the corner, broken spider webs swayed gently in the weak air flow. A dried-up dead fly hung from one of them.</p>
<p>The fluorescent lights overhead were already broken. Sharp glass pieces scattered on the floor, reflecting the pale afternoon sunlight from the window.</p>
<p>Lin Yi blinked, trying to clear the dizziness from his head. Without thinking, he reached out and touched the desk next to him.</p>
<p>Cold. Rough. With that soft, rotten feeling of decaying wood.</p>
<p>"This is..."</p>
<p>Lin Yi's eyes went wide. He rubbed his fingers hard on the dusty desktop. The fine particles spread across his fingertips, even getting into his fingerprints.</p>
<p>"This is amazing!"</p>
<p>His shock quickly turned to excitement. As an experienced gamer who had played countless games, he had tried all the big-name titles and the best VR equipment. But nothing had ever been this realistic.</p>
<p>"'Infinite Trial'... I'm so glad I got that beta test invite!"</p>
<p>Lin Yi talked to himself excitedly. He remembered that ten minutes ago, he was in his comfortable bedroom. He had put on that black helmet with no brand name and started this mysterious game.</p>
<p>No long loading bar. No awkward cutscenes. He opened his eyes, and boom - perfect seamless transfer.</p>
<p>"They even have smell simulation? This moldy smell, this rusty smell..." Lin Yi took two deep breaths of the terrible air like a weirdo, but looked totally happy. "This must need a million-dollar physics engine to calculate, right?"</p>
<p>He stood up and looked around.</p>
<p>This was a typical abandoned classroom. The door sign hung crooked on the frame, reading "Class 2, Grade 3." Desks and chairs were scattered everywhere. The blackboard had half-finished math formulas on it. Chalk dust covered the floor, as if the teacher had been writing when something happened and was dragged away, never to return.</p>
<p>Lin Yi walked to the window and looked outside.</p>
<p>The view from the third floor was pretty open. Outside was a dead campus. Grass on the playground grew waist-high. The basketball hoops were covered in rust, like the bones of giant beasts. In the distance, he could see other gray, run-down buildings. The sky hung low, with clouds showing an ominous lead-gray color.</p>
<p>A wind blew past, making dead leaves spin on the ground. When the wind hit his face, Lin Yi could even feel a slight stinging sensation and coldness.</p>
<p>"Body sensation simulation gets full marks too," Lin Yi gave it high praise.</p>
<p>He skillfully raised his right hand, drew a circle in the air, then swung it down sharply - this was the gesture from the manual for opening the menu.</p>
<p><em>Buzz.</em></p>
<p>With a soft electronic sound, a semi-transparent light blue holographic interface opened in front of him, floating in the air.</p>
<p>【Infinite Trial - Tutorial Mission】</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p>Current Mission: Abandoned School</p>
<p>Difficulty Level: ★☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>Victory Condition: Survive 30 minutes</p>
<p>Current Countdown: 29:45</p>
<p>[Character Status]</p>
<p>Health: 100/100</p>
<p>Stamina: 100/100</p>
<p>Mental Points: ???</p>
<p>Equipment: None</p>
<p>Lin Yi carefully looked at the interface, a confident smile forming on his lips.</p>
<p>"One-star difficulty, tutorial level, survive 30 minutes." He shook his head, his tone showing some contempt. "Standard escape game opening. I could recite this setup with my eyes closed: first collect resources, then hide in a closet, or use hit-and-run tactics to avoid enemies."</p>
<p>However, when his eyes scanned the status bar, his gaze paused slightly.</p>
<p>Health was green, stamina was yellow, but that line <strong>"Mental Points: ???"</strong> was a glaring red color with no numbers showing. Those three question marks were even jumping slightly, giving off a weird feeling.</p>
<p>Lin Yi tried to touch the question marks with his finger. His fingertip passed through the holographic projection. The system gave no response and didn't pop up any explanation window.</p>
<p>"Hidden stat? Or a bug in the beta version?"</p>
<p>Lin Yi frowned, but this didn't worry him too much. For expert players, unknown mechanics were actually a challenge.</p>
<p>"Whatever, I'll deal with it later."</p>
<p>He closed the status screen and opened the [Tactical Map].</p>
<p>The map showed he was currently on the third floor of a square-shaped school building. Red dots were scattered all over the campus. A quick count showed about fifteen or sixteen.</p>
<p>"Red dots mean enemy units. Not too many, and they're spread out."</p>
<p>Lin Yi quickly entered "player mode," his brain racing to analyze the situation.</p>
<p>"Following the usual pattern, tutorial enemies are usually slow-moving zombies or puppets with low awareness. As long as you don't rush into a group of them, it's basically a free win."</p>
<p>He walked to the classroom door, ready to push it open, but suddenly stepped on something sticky.</p>
<p>Lin Yi looked down.</p>
<p>It was a dark brown mark.</p>
<p>A dried bloodstain, starting from under a desk in the middle of the classroom, dragging all the way to the door, finally disappearing into the darkness of the hallway.</p>
<p>Lin Yi crouched down and wiped his finger on the stain on the floor. It felt dry and rough. His fingertip was stained with a layer of dark red powder.</p>
<p>He brought his finger to his nose and sniffed.</p>
<p>A strong, nauseating smell shot straight to the top of his head.</p>
<p>It was the smell of rotting protein mixed with rust - blood, and old dried blood that had been there a long time.</p>
<p>"Wow, wow, wow." Lin Yi wasn't scared at all. Instead, he praised it again. "This level of detail - they even got the layers of the bloody smell right. The game designer must be a real perfectionist."</p>
<p>He stood up, dusted off his hands, his eyes shining with excitement.</p>
<p>At this moment, he was completely immersed in the belief that "this is a super realistic game." What he didn't know was that this wrong belief was what the Observer called "the deadliest poison."</p>
<p>Lin Yi took a deep breath and put both hands on the classroom door.</p>
<p>The wooden door was cold and heavy.</p>
<p>"Alright, let me see what these million-dollar monsters look like."</p>
<p>He pushed the door open hard.</p>
<p><em>Creak—</em></p>
<p>The old, worn-out door hinge let out a shrill scream that echoed through the dead, empty hallway, traveling far, far away.</p>
<p>The hallway on both sides was dim, with only the sound of wind moaning. In the distance, in the shadows at the end of the hallway, something seemed to be disturbed by the sound.</p>
<p>A strange sound came over.</p>
<p>Like wet, rotten meat dragging on the ground, or like a low growl with thick phlegm stuck in the throat.</p>
<p><em>Ugh... ugh...</em></p>
<p>Dragging, heavy, irregular footsteps.</p>
<p>Lin Yi stood at the door, his lips curling up, his eyes showing no fear, only the excitement of a hunter seeing prey.</p>
<p>He glanced at the countdown.</p>
<p>"30 minutes? Too long."</p>
<p>He clenched his fists and confidently whispered to the darkness deep in the hallway:</p>
<p>"This kind of tutorial level, I can speed-run it in 10 minutes."</p>
<p><em>[Observation Record - Sample 17]</em></p>
<p><em>Time: 1 minute 30 seconds after mission start</em></p>
<p><em>Status: Extremely confident, adrenaline levels slightly elevated.</em></p>
<p><em>Assessment: Sample is completely immersed in virtual illusion, lacking basic respect for deadly environmental dangers. As predicted, modern entertainment industry has dulled human survival instincts.</em></p>
<p><em>Prediction: Due to underestimating enemy, survival rate lowered to 5%.</em></p>
