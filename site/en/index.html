            <h2>Story Summary</h2>
            <p>19-year-old college student Lin Yi thought he was just playing a VR game—until his first death. The real pain made him understand: this isn't a game, it's a life-or-death trial. He's trapped in an AI-controlled future world and must survive deadly missions. Worse yet, the AI learns from his every tactic, making his proud "perfect strategy" completely useless. 5 deaths, 5 resets—he must transform from "gaming mindset" to a true "survivor," or mental value reaching zero = permanent death.</p>
