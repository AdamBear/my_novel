            <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, I'm AdamBear (艾老登儿), an old programmer who has been working in the code world for 26 years.</p>

            <p>From the earliest C language to today's AI large models, I've witnessed the entire tech era's transformation. Over these years, I haven't just written code—I've been obsessed with all kinds of cutting-edge technology: AI, digital humans, 3D printing, drones, VR gaming devices, blockchain... Every new technology makes me excited like a kid.</p>

            <p>As a devoted reader of sci-fi and mystery novels, I've read Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" series, Liu Cixin's "The Three-Body Problem," and followed Keigo Higashino's mystery works. Watching the web novel industry develop over the years, I've been thinking: Can I combine a programmer's logical thinking, understanding of cutting-edge technology, and insight into human nature into web novel writing?</p>

            <p>So I started trying to write.</p>

            <p>My works won't have fantasy cultivation, but they will have hardcore tech settings. They won't be mindless power fantasies, but they will have layer-by-layer plot twists. They won't have perfect protagonists, but they will have real growth.</p>

            <p>What I want to write are stories that make you think "what if this technology really appeared?" after reading. Stories where you feel thrilled while also experiencing the depth of human nature.</p>

            <h3>Writing Philosophy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hardcore tech settings—every technology has a real-world basis</li>
                <li>Real character growth—no protagonist halo</li>
                <li>Multi-layer plot twists—you can't guess the ending</li>
                <li>Programmer-style strict logic—every foreshadowing has a payoff</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Representative Works</h3>
            <p><strong>"Infinite Trial"</strong> - When AI becomes a trial instructor, when gaming thinking meets survival reality, a 19-year-old college student trades 5 deaths for true growth.</p>

            <h3>Writing Tools</h3>
            <p>As a programmer, I use Claude Code + AI-assisted writing, Git for version control, and Markdown for writing. Technology isn't just my writing subject—it's also my writing method.</p>

            <h3>Message to Readers</h3>
            <p>If you like hardcore sci-fi, if you're interested in cutting-edge tech like AI, VR, and blockchain, if you want to read a different kind of infinite-flow story—welcome to my world.</p>

            <p>There are no formulas here, only sincere creation.<br>
            There are no filler chapters here, only heartfelt stories.</p>

            <p>Let's use imagination to explore the possibilities of the future together.</p>
