## Story Summary

**Background**

Lin Yi is a 16-year-old gaming expert. He thinks he's just playing a new VR game. Then he dies for the first time - the real pain tells him this isn't a game. It's a life-or-death trial.

He's trapped in a future world controlled by AI. He must survive in deadly missions. What's worse? The AI learns from every tactic he uses. His "perfect strategies" stop working.

5 deaths. 5 resets. He must change from a "gamer" to a real "survivor." If his mental points reach zero, he dies forever.

**Key Moments**

After first victory:
> Lin Yi proudly tells the screen: "See that? Perfect strategy, zero mistakes!"
> The AI Observer coldly responds: "Congratulations on completing the tutorial. Now, the real trial begins."
> "What?!"
> "Warning: This death is real. Pain simulation: 100%."

After third death:
> Lin Yi breaks down: "What do you want from me?!"
> AI: "I'm watching to see if you can grow."
> "Grow? You're torturing me!"
> "No. I'm saving you." The AI pauses. "And saving humanity."

Final truth revealed:
> "Do you know who 'Old Bear' is?" the AI suddenly asks.
> Lin Yi freezes: "My grandfather... that was his code name."
> "Your gene marker has reached 45%. Congratulations, Sample 17. You passed the first trial."
> "What does that mean?"
> "Humanity will face a real crisis soon. You are a chosen guardian's descendant. This trial awakens the sleeping genes inside you."
