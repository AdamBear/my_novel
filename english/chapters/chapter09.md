# **Chapter 9: Refraction of Light**

## **Section 1: Dark Forest Law**

The air in the pharmacy was filled with a nauseating sweet-sour smell. It was a mixture of broken glucose injections, moldy Chinese herbs, and some lingering corpse stench.

"Give me that stuff."

In the darkness, Sample 44's (Scarface) voice was particularly harsh. He deliberately didn't lower his voice, even carrying a threatening tone.

Lin Yi tightly clutched the box of **[Strong Painkillers]** and two rolls of **[Sterile Bandages]** he'd just found deep in the counter. In this instance with 100% pain synchronization, painkillers weren't just recovery items—they were lifelines preventing shock or mental collapse from severe pain.

"I found this." Lin Yi's voice was light. He was trying to control his volume while pressing his body against the medicine cabinet, using the terrain to protect his back.

"I won't say it twice."

Scarface sneered, heavy footsteps approaching. "Kid, get the situation straight. This isn't your little pretend game. Here, the biggest fist makes the rules."

Then he did something that made Lin Yi's pupils contract sharply.

Scarface lifted his foot and kicked the metal medicine cabinet beside him hard.

*CLANG!*

The metallic crash echoed through the silent pharmacy like a death warrant.

"Hear that?" Scarface grinned wickedly in the darkness. "The monsters on this floor are very sensitive to sound. If you don't hand it over, I'll keep banging. I have the [Hardened Skin] talent anyway—even if those invisible things come, I can take a few hits. As for you, this tender college student... hehe."

This was naked extortion.

He was using Lin Yi's life as leverage.

Standing not far away, Su Liang (Sample 99) remained silent. She neither helped Lin Yi nor participated in the robbery. She was observing, like a calm cat, assessing which side had more survival value.

Lin Yi's heart pounded violently, but his brain became abnormally calm under the adrenaline rush.

Angry? Of course. But in this place, anger was cheap.

He realized that in this dark forest called "Lightless Hospital," so-called morality and teammate loyalty were cheaper than expired glucose.

"Fine, take it."

Lin Yi took a deep breath, his tone full of compromise and fear. "Don't bang anymore... I'll give it to you."

He slowly extended his hand, seemingly about to hand over the medicine.

But under the cover of darkness, his other hand quietly pulled out a sharp triangular glass shard from his pocket—something he'd picked up in the corridor earlier.

He wasn't going to attack Scarface. With his strength, he couldn't break through the man's defense at all.

His target was light.

## **Section 2: Death's Spotlight**

In the corner of the pharmacy ceiling, there was a faulty emergency light.

It emitted extremely weak red light, flickering every few seconds. This light wasn't enough to illuminate the environment or trigger the monsters' phototropic aggression—because it was too dim and diffusely reflected.

But what if... these scattered light rays were focused?

Lin Yi pretended to tremble as he shuffled forward, while rapidly calculating angles in his mind.

Angle of incidence, angle of reflection. Light source, glass, target.

"That's right, those who understand the times are wise." Scarface smugly extended his hand, groping in the darkness for the medicine Lin Yi was handing over.

Just as Scarface's fingers were about to touch the medicine box, Lin Yi stopped.

At this moment, the emergency light happened to flicker on.

Lin Yi's wrist flipped extremely subtly, adjusting the triangular glass shard to a precise angle.

The weak red light hit the glass surface, and through refraction and focusing, formed a small but extremely bright dark red spot.

This spot was like a red eye, precisely projected onto Scarface's bald head, even shining into his eyes.

"Damn! What's shining in my eyes?"

Scarface instinctively raised his hand to block the red light in front of his eyes.

And in that very second.

*SCREECH—!!!*

That scalp-numbing bone-rubbing sound suddenly erupted from deep in the pharmacy.

If the previous sounds were whispers, now this sound was like countless locusts vibrating their wings.

That was absolute hatred for "light."

In this absolutely dark ecosystem, any focused light source was a provocation to the predators, a heresy that must be eliminated.

Though the light didn't directly shine on the monsters, that "luminous body" marked by the light spot—Scarface—was the brightest target in the night sky to the monsters.

"Run!"

Lin Yi shouted in his mind.

He suddenly pulled back his hand holding the medicine, rolled backward, and dove directly under the nearby dispensing counter.

## **Section 3: Killing with a Borrowed Knife**

"What..."

Before Scarface could react to why Lin Yi suddenly disappeared, a foul wind was already rushing toward his face.

He couldn't see the monster. But he could feel the airflow of the air being torn.

*Squelch!*

Without any preamble, without turn-based testing.

An invisible claw appeared out of nowhere, instantly piercing through Scarface's proud pectoral muscles. Even with the [Hardened Skin] talent, before the elite monsters of a two-star instance, it was merely like cutting frozen meat instead of tofu.

"AHHHHH—!!!"

Screams echoed through the pharmacy.

Then came the second and third tearing sounds.

Lin Yi curled up in the shadow under the counter, tightly covering his mouth and nose.

Through the gap, by that flickering red light, he saw a horrifying scene:

Scarface's body was lifted into mid-air by an invisible force. His limbs convulsed wildly, blood spraying down like a fountain, soaking the medicine boxes on the floor.

His screams quickly turned into the hissing sound of air leaking from his trachea.

Something was gnawing at his throat.

"Save... save..."

Scarface desperately reached out toward the darkness, in the direction where Su Liang was.

But there was no one there. Su Liang had already retreated like a ghost to the emergency exit door the moment Lin Yi adjusted the glass angle.

Ten seconds.

Just ten seconds, and the veteran who had been so arrogant moments ago became a pile of meat that no longer twitched.

As that "luminous body" was extinguished (covered by blood or the light source blocked), that group of invisible monsters seemed to calm their fury.

*Click... click...*

They dragged their trophy, slowly disappearing into the dark depths.

The pharmacy returned to deathly silence.

Only Lin Yi's own heartbeat, like thunder.

## **Section 4: New Contract**

A long time later.

After confirming the monsters had gone far, Lin Yi slowly crawled out from under the counter.

He still tightly clutched that box of painkillers, his knuckles white from excessive force.

He stepped over the warm, sticky liquid on the floor—that was the last trace Scarface left in this world. Lin Yi didn't glance at the corpse remains, his eyes terrifyingly cold.

He walked to the emergency exit door.

Su Liang was standing there. She hadn't run, just quietly leaning against the wall, playing with a scalpel in her hand.

Though he couldn't see her expression clearly, Lin Yi could feel that this woman's gaze toward him had changed.

No longer looking at a rookie who could die at any moment, but at one of her own kind.

"Using the law of light refraction to create an artificial aggro marker."

Su Liang's voice was light, carrying a hint of amusement. "Good physics knowledge, college student."

"He was too noisy."

Lin Yi opened the painkiller box, popped out two pills and swallowed them dry, then threw the remaining half toward Su Liang.

Su Liang raised her hand and precisely caught the medicine box in the darkness.

"Hush money?" Su Liang asked.

"Advance payment."

Lin Yi wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, his voice hoarse but steady. "Your hearing talent is useful, and my brain is useful too. We cooperate, go to the generator room."

"What if I refuse?"

"Then you'd better kill me now." Lin Yi turned around, his back to Su Liang, directly exposing his defenseless back to her. "Otherwise, when we encounter the Boss later, I can't guarantee this glass won't refract light onto you."

Silence.

A few seconds later, Su Liang's light footsteps came from behind. She walked to Lin Yi's side and didn't attack.

"Deal." She said, "Go left, I hear the elevator shaft wind."

Lin Yi smiled silently in the darkness.

That was the first time he understood: In the infinite trial, the strongest alliance isn't based on loyalty, but on **the ability to mutually destroy each other**.
