# Chapter 26: Frozen Tundra Sniper

## Section 1: White Reaper

The atmosphere in the carriage had become oppressively heavy due to the truth about the "living brain," and that sweet nutrient solution smell seemed impossible to dispel. The sole surviving mercenary sat on the ground, pouring cheap vodka down his throat, seemingly trying to numb the guilt of escorting his own kind to their death with alcohol. The mechanic was in the corner patching up the damaged life support chamber, his hands shaking like a Parkinson's patient. Lin Yi leaned against the observation window, watching the pitch-black eternal night outside, mentally calculating remaining fuel and distance. Suddenly, the back of his neck contracted sharply, that familiar sensation—like a red-hot needle piercing his skin—instantly exploded. Not from inside the carriage, but from outside the window, from that void of darkness.

Get down! Lin Yi's roar hadn't fully left his throat when a dull, watermelon-smashing sound exploded in the carriage. There was no gunshot, no flash. Only the mercenary sitting across from him—his head, as if slapped by an invisible giant hand, instantly burst into a mist of red and white. The headless corpse still held the vodka bottle by inertia, dark red blood spraying all over the mechanic. Then a fist-sized melted hole appeared in the carriage wall, its edges showing bright red high-temperature fusion. Electromagnetic railgun, Lin Yi's pupils contracted sharply, his body instinctively diving sideways, pressing Su Liang, who hadn't reacted yet, beneath him. That weapon had no sound, bullets traveling at five times the speed of sound—by the time you heard it, you were already dead.

## Section 2: Ghost Rider

The carriage erupted into chaos. The mechanic let out a pig-like scream, clutching his head and diving into the gap beneath the container. The doctor collapsed limply on the ground. Only Lin Yi maintained absolute calm. He crawled on the ground like a snake, sliding to the headless corpse and grabbing the heavy sniper rifle the mercenary had dropped. This was a modified anti-materiel weapon—though inferior to the railgun outside, it was currently the only thing that could return fire. Where is he, Lin Yi asked in a low voice, his tone cold as ice. Su Liang lay beside him, eyes closed, both hands pressed against the cold carriage floor. Her ears filtered out wind sounds, engine sounds, and mechanical operation noise, trying to capture that lethal frequency in the chaos.

Nine o'clock direction, Su Liang's voice trembled slightly, twelve hundred meters away. He's moving... very fast, keeping pace with the train. He's riding something, a maglev board. Lin Yi raised his head slightly, looking out through the melted bullet hole. On the vast snowfield to the train's left, a white shadow was gliding at high speed close to the ground. The person wore white exoskeleton armor, nearly blending with the snow, riding a board spraying blue flames beneath their feet, holding an absurdly long electromagnetic rifle. This wasn't an ordinary Raider—this was a veteran hunter with mechanical modifications. The white ghost raised the gun again, blue arcs beginning to gather at the muzzle. He's charging, Su Liang screamed, firing in three seconds.

## Section 3: Blind Fire Game Theory

Lin Yi had no time to aim. Outside wind speed was thirty meters per second, train speed three hundred kilometers per hour, plus vibration and visual interference—conventional shooting couldn't possibly hit. But he had Su Liang. Be my eyes, Lin Yi roared, suddenly smashing the observation window in front of him with the rifle butt. Bone-piercing cold wind instantly poured in, making it impossible to open one's eyes. He mounted the heavy gun barrel on the window frame and closed his eyes, concentrating all perception on hearing and intuition. Su Liang's fingers gripped the floor so hard her nails left marks, constructing the moving target's coordinates in her mind.

Left adjust two degrees, elevation zero point five, ignore wind drift. Su Liang's speech was extremely rapid, like a precision computer. Lin Yi's finger rested on the trigger, adjusting his breathing. In that instant, his [Danger Sense] stung again, but this time he didn't dodge—instead, he used this pain in reverse. Where the pain was strongest was where the enemy's gun pointed, which was the enemy's position. Bang! Lin Yi squeezed the trigger. The large-caliber bullet left the chamber, cutting through the night sky. The distant white ghost suddenly dodged sideways, the bullet grazing past his board and hitting the frozen earth, splashing up a snow wave. Missed! Su Liang shouted. But his rhythm was disrupted! Lin Yi didn't stop, pulling the bolt, ejecting the shell, chambering. This wasn't just shooting—this was forcing the opponent to reposition. That sniper clearly hadn't expected anyone in the carriage could return fire. He abandoned charging, controlling the board to make a strange S-shaped maneuver across the ground, trying to evade the ballistic trajectory.

## Section 4: Death Curve

There's a curve ahead! The mechanic shouted from under the table with a sob, it's a big loop! We need to slow down! Don't slow down! Lin Yi shouted sternly. He looked at the gradually tilting horizon ahead—the train was about to enter a massive C-shaped curve. This was the last chance. At the curve, the train would generate enormous centrifugal force, and that sniper gliding outside would have to drastically adjust the board's angle to maintain parallel movement, even fighting stronger centrifugal force. In that instant, his trajectory would be locked.

Su Liang, call out the curve apex! Lin Yi leaned his body out the window, the gale cutting his face like knives, frost instantly forming on his goggles. Three, two, one! Entering curve! Su Liang shouted. The train tilted sharply, the massive metal axles emitting an unbearable screech. Lin Yi felt his internal organs about to be thrown out. And on the outer snowfield, that white ghost was indeed forced to lower his center of gravity, the board's tail spraying long flames to counter centrifugal force. His position was locked. Lin Yi didn't use his eyes—in his mind appeared a red ballistic line, the overlap of [Danger Sense] and Su Liang's [Sonar Positioning] creating a kill path. Go to hell. Lin Yi squeezed the trigger.

Bang! This shot carried all of Lin Yi's mental power and killing intent. The bullet penetrated wind and snow, precisely predicting the sniper's position under centrifugal force. In the distant darkness, a dazzling fireball suddenly exploded. The bullet had hit the board's power core. That invincible sniper didn't even get to scream before becoming a burning fireball, crashing into the hard frozen earth like a meteor under inertia. With a thunderous boom, the explosion's firelight illuminated half the night sky, then was left far behind by the train.

It's over. Lin Yi retracted into the carriage, his whole body collapsing limply against the wall, the rifle barrel still smoking. Su Liang opened her eyes, two trails of bloody tears flowing down her cheeks—the price of overusing her hearing. And behind them, the jar containing the living brain still made its tick-tock sounds, those eyes that wouldn't close in death seeming to coldly observe all this, as if mocking humanity's meaningless mutual slaughter.
