# **Chapter 11: Phantom Pain Anesthesia**

## **Section 1: Sterile Hell**

The temperature in the surgical area was at least ten degrees colder than outside.

Passing through the partition door of the laundry room, the smell of moldy decay in the air suddenly disappeared, replaced by a suffocating, overly pure disinfectant smell.

This place was too clean.

No bloodstains, no dust, even the mycelium in the corners had been cleaned spotless. The white tiles reflected pale cold light under the weak emergency lamps, like a giant morgue freezer.

"Heartbeat."

Su Liang suddenly stopped. Her body pressed against the cold wall, fingertips slightly pale.

"In that direction... in that largest operating room." Her voice was extremely low, even carrying a hint of trembling. "That heartbeat... abnormally slow. Only four beats per minute."

*Thump...*

(Fifteen seconds of deathly silence)

*Thump...*

Lin Yi held his breath. Though he couldn't hear the heartbeat Su Liang mentioned, he could feel the heavy oppressive feeling in the air.

The operating room's double doors were half-open.

Through the light leaking from the door crack, Lin Yi saw that thing.

It wore an absurdly oversized green surgical gown, clean but with varying shades of color, like old bloodstains that had been repeatedly washed. Its height approached two and a half meters, hunched back, dragging a bone saw still slowly rotating, connected to a portable motor.

What made Lin Yi's scalp tingle most was its face.

It had no eyes.

The eye socket positions had been crudely sewn shut with black surgical thread, the dense thread ends crawling on its face like centipedes. But as compensation, its ears were huge and deformed, the auricles trembling like radar from time to time, capturing even the slightest sound of dust particles colliding in the air.

Boss: Blind Eye Chief Surgeon.

"This is the gatekeeper for clearing the instance." Lin Yi judged in his mind.

Just pass through this operating room, and behind it was the backup generator room.

But how to get through?

This monster's hearing was obviously a hundred times stronger than ordinary nurses. Even the sound of bare feet stepping on the ground would probably sound like drumming to its ears.

"There's poison gas." Su Liang suddenly covered her mouth and nose, brow furrowed. "If you don't want to go crazy, hold your breath."

## **Section 2: Sweet Almond Scent**

Before Lin Yi could react, a faint sweet smell drilled into his nasal cavity.

That wasn't the smell of formalin, but a fragrance similar to bitter almonds mixed with rotten apples.

It was leaking from the gas tank behind the doctor.

"Cough..."

Lin Yi's throat itched, instinctively wanting to cough. He desperately pinched his own neck, forcibly holding back that cough until his face turned red.

But the poison gas had already entered his lungs.

His vision began to blur.

The originally straight white corridor actually began to twist and deform like melting wax. The tiles on the walls peeled off piece by piece, revealing the gray-black concrete structure underneath.

The originally cold operating room lights gradually became dim yellow, flickering.

The silence in his ears disappeared. Replaced by bursts of noisy reading sounds, and the *squeak squeak* sound of chalk rubbing on a blackboard.

"Student Lin Yi, can you solve this problem?"

A familiar voice rang in his ear.

Lin Yi suddenly turned around.

Su Liang was gone. The operating room was gone.

He was standing in a dilapidated classroom. The blackboard read "Study hard, improve daily," but the red paint flowed down like blood.

In front of his desk stood a male student in a school uniform.

The student kept his head down, face unclear, only showing the rusty wire stuck in his chest—the one used for lockpicking in the first instance.

"Why didn't you save me?"

The student slowly raised his head.

That face was already half-rotten, eyeball dangling outside the socket, mouth making that wet friction sound. "You said... we would clear it together."

"No... this isn't real..."

Lin Yi staggered backward, knocking over the chair behind him.

*CLANG!*

This loud noise echoed in the "classroom."

But in the reality dimension, this was Lin Yi at the operating room entrance, knocking over a stainless steel tray.

## **Section 3: Reality's Bone Saw**

Real world.

The moment that metallic crash sounded, the blind eye doctor who had been pacing slowly suddenly stopped.

Its sewn eyelids twitched violently, huge ears turning toward the sound source.

*SCREECH—!!!*

The bone saw in its hand instantly accelerated, emitting a piercing high-frequency noise.

It moved.

No longer slow movement, but like an out-of-control tank, carrying suffocating foul wind, charging straight toward Lin Yi who was trapped in hallucinations at the door.

"Lin Yi! Wake up!!"

Su Liang anxiously hissed beside him. She didn't dare shout loudly, only forcefully pinching Lin Yi's arm, nails digging deep into flesh.

But Lin Yi had no reaction. His pupils were dilated, muttering: "I didn't mean to harm you... I just wanted to survive..."

In Lin Yi's vision, that zombie student was spreading his arms to pounce on him, demanding his life.

But in reality, it was the blind eye doctor raising the bone saw high, bringing down the cold light of death.

"Damn it!"

Su Liang's eyes turned cold. She didn't choose to help Lin Yi block the blade, but instantly released her grip, her whole body bouncing sideways like a cat, hiding in the shadows.

This was instinct. Also the contract.

*SQUELCH!*

The high-speed rotating bone saw didn't directly sever Lin Yi's neck, because at the last moment, out of fear of that zombie phantom, he instinctively leaned back.

The saw blade grazed the outside of his left arm.

Flesh flew.

A large chunk of skin and flesh along with the sleeve was instantly pulled into the saw teeth, ground into pulp. Blood sprayed out like a high-pressure water gun, splashing on the snow-white walls, scalding hot.

"AHHHHH—!!!"

Intense pain finally pierced through the fog of hallucination.

The classroom before Lin Yi's eyes instantly shattered, the zombie classmate's face becoming the blind eye doctor's terrifying mask sewn full of threads.

He returned to reality.

But this reality was worse than the nightmare.

That drilling pain, along the nerve network of his left arm, frantically bombarded his brain. 100% pain synchronization, no discount.

"Blood..."

Lin Yi covered his wound, stumbling backward.

Warm liquid flowed through his fingers, dripping on the floor.

In the air, that bloody smell originally masked by disinfectant began to spread rapidly.

The blind eye doctor stopped attacking.

It tilted its head slightly, like a gourmet connoisseur tasting wine, deeply inhaling the fresh bloody smell diffusing in the air.

Its mouth corner—that mouth originally hidden under the mask—split open, revealing the staggered sharp teeth like a shark inside.

It had locked on.

In this blind person's world, the current Lin Yi was no longer an invisible person.

He was a walking loudspeaker, a living blood bag emitting enticing fragrance.

No matter how he held his breath, how he lightened his footsteps, those drops of falling blood were announcing his position to the entire instance.

*Drip. Drip.*

That was death's countdown.
