# Chapter 27: Darkness Before Dawn

## Section 1: Footsteps of the Colossus

The train floor was vibrating, but it wasn't the jolting of wheels rolling over frozen earth—it was a more rhythmic, deeper pulsation, like a massive heart beating in the depths of the earth's crust. Su Liang suddenly clutched her ears, a trickle of blood flowing through her fingers. Her face was deathly pale, her whole body curled in the corner of the control panel, trembling. "It's coming... it's coming..." Su Liang's voice carried a sob. That massive sound wave pressure was, for her enhanced hearing, no different from sticking her head into a roaring jet engine. "Too big... that's a mountain... a moving iron mountain." Lin Yi grabbed a handhold to steady himself, looking back through the frost-covered observation window of the cockpit.

At the end of this eternal night, in the blizzard dancing across the sky, two crimson searchlights lit up in the high sky, at least a hundred meters high. Then lightning split the sky, illuminating the pursuer's true face. It was a titan giant constructed from countless scrapped machinery, gears, and steel plates. Each step it took smashed a massive crater into the frozen earth, splashing snow waves dozens of meters high. It didn't need to run—merely striding, it was already catching up to this train that was gradually slowing due to fuel depletion. "Warning: Fuel remaining 5%. Estimated stop in three minutes." The cold system notification sounded like a death countdown. The mercenary collapsed hopelessly on the ground, his gun dropped beside him. "It's over... how do we fight that thing? That's a god."

## Section 2: Severing the Tail to Survive

"God my ass, that's just a pile of scrap metal." Lin Yi's gaze was terrifyingly cold. He grabbed the mechanic who had already wet his pants and pressed him against the main control panel. "Listen, I need you to do something. Unlock all carriages except the locomotive." The mechanic looked at Lin Yi tremblingly. "But... but the brain is still in Carriage Nine..." "Move it over." Lin Yi turned to look at the doctor and mercenary. "You have thirty seconds to carry that brain jar to the locomotive. If you don't want to die, hurry!" Under death's whip, human potential is limitless. The two men rushed into the rear carriage like madmen, carrying that heavy life support chamber and stumbling across the connection bridge.

The moment they stepped into the locomotive, Lin Yi didn't hesitate to slam down the red separation button. With a loud clang, Carriage Nine and the few remaining rear carriages detached from the locomotive. Having shed its load, the remaining locomotive instantly shot forward like an unbridled wild horse, speed surging. "It's not over yet." Lin Yi looked at the relentlessly pursuing titan. It had already extended its massive mechanical hand, grabbing the just-detached Carriage Nine and crushing it like a tin can. "Mechanic, detonate the rear carriages' backup fuel tanks." The mechanic froze. "That requires remote authorization..." "You have authorization! Detonate it!" Lin Yi's gun muzzle pressed against the mechanic's temple. The mechanic screamed and hit the enter key.

*BOOM—!!!*

A massive fireball rose in the blizzard. That was the power of several tons of high-energy fuel detonating simultaneously. The enormous shockwave, carrying countless metal fragments, slammed viciously into the titan's chest. That invincible mechanical giant was pushed backward by this force, its massive body losing balance and crashing heavily onto the frozen earth, triggering a small earthquake.

## Section 3: Bullet Without Brakes

Borrowing the massive thrust from the explosion, the single locomotive shot forward like a bullet leaving the chamber, racing madly along the rails. The speedometer needle had maxed out, the carriage body shaking violently, as if it might disintegrate at any moment. "Ahead! Look ahead!" The doctor pointed forward and shouted. Through the blizzard, a towering black wall gradually revealed itself. It was a massive metal gate connecting heaven and earth, printed with a faded Ark emblem. This was the destination: the entrance to Ark One. But that door was closed. No sign of opening, no deceleration buffer zone.

"They... they won't open the door?" Su Liang asked, enduring the ringing in her ears. "Of course not." Lin Yi gripped the control lever tightly, looking at the approaching black giant wall, the corner of his mouth curling into a mad smile. "To the Ark, we're returnees who might carry viruses, refugees who need isolation and inspection. How could they possibly open their doors for us?" "Then what do we do? We'll crash to death!" The mercenary roared. "Then we knock." Lin Yi's voice was exceptionally clear amid the roaring engine. "Use these hundreds of tons of steel to knock open their turtle shell." He didn't slow down—instead, he pushed the thrust lever to maximum. All energy no longer went to life support systems, but was entirely injected into the power furnace. The locomotive let out an unbearable screech, transforming into a burning meteor, charging straight toward that steel gate representing "hope."

## Section 4: Collision

Ten seconds until impact. Lin Yi rushed to the life support chamber containing the brain, using safety belts to bind himself and Su Liang tightly to the tank's support frame. "Hold tight!"

Three seconds until impact. That biological brain that had only emitted death-wish signals now seemed to sense the approaching destruction. Those eyes that wouldn't close in death rotated violently, the display screen's brainwaves pulling into a flat line. It was screaming—not in fear, but in excitement.

Zero seconds until impact.

*BOOM—*

The world lost sound in that instant. Massive inertia pressed everyone hard against the bulkhead. Lin Yi felt his internal organs shift, his retinas filled with stars. The sounds of twisting metal, shattering glass, and breaking bones mixed together, becoming a symphony called "destruction." The locomotive's ram, like a red-hot dinner knife, viciously cut through Ark's heavy armored door. Sparks flew, smoke billowed.

After an unknown time, the shaking finally stopped. Lin Yi choked awake from unconsciousness, the air thick with acrid burnt smells and the ozone stench of short-circuited electronics. He struggled to unbuckle the safety belt and crawled out from the deformed wreckage. Before him was a scene of devastation—the locomotive had completely embedded itself into the Ark's interior, becoming a pile of scrap metal. And beyond that scrap metal was a blindingly bright corridor. A group of soldiers in white protective suits, holding electromagnetic rifles, stood in formation, gun muzzles aimed at these uninvited guests. Lin Yi wiped the blood from his face, looking at those fully armed "fellow humans," revealing a bleak smile. "Delivery complete." He said hoarsely, then his eyes rolled back and he collapsed.
