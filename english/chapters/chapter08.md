# **Chapter 8: Bone Friction Sounds**

## **Section 1: Forbidden Senses**

"Take off shoes?"

In the darkness, that rough male voice (Sample 44) scoffed, his tone carrying obvious contempt and provocation. "Little girl, are you scared stupid? You want me to go barefoot in this place full of unknown liquids?"

"If you want to die, be my guest."

That cool female voice (Sample 99, Su Liang) showed no emotional fluctuation, as if stating an objective fact. "When that newbie died just now, what were you listening to? I was listening to that thing's footsteps."

Lin Yi crouched in the corner, silently nodding.

Though he couldn't see, his evaluation of this woman codenamed 99 increased a few points. Being able to calmly analyze sound samples in extreme panic—that was definitely a veteran's quality.

He had already taken off his sneakers, tying them lightly around his waist. Now his feet were bare on the cold, slippery tiles. The sensation was nauseating—like stepping on some mollusk's secretions, the bone-chilling cold shooting straight up from his soles to his skull.

But he didn't care.

After those two heart-wrenching death trials (referring to the loops in the first instance), his nerve endings had learned how to find security in disgust. Going barefoot not only eliminated footstep sounds but also allowed him to sense ground vibrations through his soles.

"Playing tricks."

Sample 44 cursed as he seemed to rummage through his backpack. "I don't believe this crap. This is a two-star instance, not a death trap. How can we play without vision? The system must have given us lighting tools."

"Don't move!" Lin Yi suddenly spoke up.

His voice was hoarse and low, like air squeezed from deep in his throat.

The air in the darkness froze for a moment.

"Who?" Sample 44 alertly turned toward Lin Yi's direction.

"Who I am doesn't matter." Lin Yi kept his voice low, speaking rapidly. "If you don't want to become the next pile of rotten meat, don't take out that flashlight. Can't you smell it? There are spores in the air here. These fungal monsters are usually phototropic."

This was Lin Yi's test. He wasn't actually sure if the monsters were phototropic, but he had to stop this idiot from turning on the light.

However, human arrogance often defeats reason.

"Ha? Fungus?" Sample 44 sneered, accompanied by the sound of a zipper opening. "I passed the one-star instance 'Midnight Slaughterhouse.' What scene haven't I seen? Being blind here is just waiting to die!"

*Click.*

That was the crisp sound of a switch being pressed.

Lin Yi's heart contracted sharply. He didn't waste more words but instead, like a startled cockroach, instantly dropped to all fours and silently slid toward the direction away from the sound source—under the triage desk to his side rear.

The next second.

A blinding, pale beam of light pierced through the thick darkness like a sword.

## **Section 2: Invisible Fury**

Light.

The long-awaited light instantly illuminated half the hall.

Lin Yi squinted, and through the gap in the triage desk, he finally saw the surrounding environment clearly with that beam of light.

This wasn't a hospital hall at all.

This was practically a giant morgue. The walls were covered with dark green mycelium, pulsing like blood vessels. On the floor lay several corpses in hospital gowns scattered about, some completely covered by fungus, transformed into eerie cocoons.

Standing in the center of the hall was Sample 44, a burly bald man with a scar running through his left eye. He held a tactical high-intensity flashlight, a fierce smile on his face.

"See! I told you it's fine!"

Scarface waved the flashlight, the beam sweeping around. "What the hell, come out and show yourself to..."

His voice stopped abruptly.

Because when the beam swept across the waiting area on the left side of the hall, everyone saw it.

The air there was distorting.

In what had seemed like empty space, under the strong light, some semi-transparent outlines appeared. Like oil stains in water, or air distorted by heat waves. They were roughly human-sized, with disproportionately long limbs, crouching in extremely strange postures on chairs, the ceiling, and walls.

The number... at least twenty.

They had been motionless.

But the moment the light touched them, those semi-transparent outlines began to tremble violently.

*SCREECH—!!!*

An extremely sharp, high-frequency shriek instantly erupted, like countless fingernails frantically scraping a blackboard.

That wasn't a cry. It was the noise produced by bones rubbing together at high frequency!

"Holy crap..." Scarface's pupils dilated instantly.

Those things moved.

If the monsters in the darkness before were elegant assassins, then under the light, they became completely out-of-control mad dogs.

They were enraged by the light.

*BOOM!*

That group of invisible things rushed toward the light source—Scarface—like a tide. Though their bodies couldn't be seen, you could see the accumulated water on the ground being splashed up, could see the ripples of air being torn at high speed.

"Get away!!"

Scarface reacted extremely fast—he was indeed a veteran. The moment he realized something was wrong, he made an extremely vicious decision.

He didn't turn off the flashlight.

He swung his arm hard and threw the lit tactical flashlight toward another corner not far from him—where a young survivor (Sample 21) who hadn't dared to make a sound was huddled.

"Catch!" Scarface roared.

The unfortunate young man instinctively reached out to catch the glowing object flying toward him.

The flashlight traced an arc through the air, landing at the young man's feet. The beam illuminated his terrified face.

The monster horde instantly changed direction.

The death wave that had been rushing toward Scarface made a sharp turn in mid-air, all pouncing toward that light source.

"No! Help—"

The young man's scream lasted only half a second.

Then came the scalp-numbing sound of flesh being torn.

*Squelch! Squelch! Rip!*

Under the strong light, Lin Yi witnessed the most horrifying scene of his life:

The young man's body floated up out of nowhere, his limbs pulled in four directions like he was being drawn and quartered. Then his abdomen suddenly caved in, as if bitten by an invisible giant mouth.

Blood sprayed, staining the flashlight on the ground.

The beam flickered a few times in the pool of blood, then finally went out.

## **Section 3: Auditory Radar**

The hall returned to darkness.

But that heart-pounding chewing sound and bone-rubbing sound didn't stop—instead, they became clearer and denser in the darkness.

That beam of light had not only killed one person but, more importantly—it had awakened all the monsters on this floor.

*Click... click... click...*

The sounds were everywhere. Front, back, left, right, even in the ventilation ducts overhead.

Lin Yi curled up in the narrow space under the triage desk, his hands tightly covering his mouth and nose, forcing himself into a "feigned death" state.

His heart was pounding violently in his chest, but he desperately controlled his diaphragm, making his breathing long and faint.

"Don't move... absolutely don't move..."

He chanted silently in his mind.

Just then, a slight, almost imperceptible footstep stopped outside the triage desk.

Not the monsters' bone sounds. It was the sound of soft-soled shoes stepping on slime.

Someone had come over.

Lin Yi's muscles instantly tensed, his hand quietly gripping a piece of tile shard he'd picked up from the floor.

"Crawl left."

An extremely low voice drilled into his ear. It was that woman, Su Liang.

"Three o'clock direction is the pharmacy corridor, the friction sounds are least there." Her voice was terrifyingly calm, like solving a math problem. "That scarface ran right, he drew away most of the monsters."

Lin Yi didn't respond immediately.

He listened carefully in the darkness.

Sure enough, heavy running sounds and monster pursuit sounds came from the right corridor. And on the left... relatively quiet, with only sporadic *click* sounds.

This woman had sharp ears.

In this pitch-black death trap, if you didn't want to stumble around like a blind person, this woman was the best "radar."

Lin Yi put away the tile shard and nodded in the direction of the sound in the darkness—though the other person couldn't see it.

"Cooperate?" he asked in a breath.

"Temporarily." Su Liang answered.

The two reached a fragile understanding.

Lin Yi slowly crawled out from under the triage desk, like a giant gecko on all fours, following Su Liang's extremely faint movement sounds toward the dark depths on the left.

But he still didn't let his guard down.

In this instance, the monsters were invisible.

And human hearts were darker than monsters.
