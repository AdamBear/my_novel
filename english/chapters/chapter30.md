# Chapter 30: Prison Break

## Section 1: Laws of the Incinerator

The end of the corridor was an isolation door radiating high temperature. Coming from behind the door wasn't just heat waves, but that nauseating burnt smell Lin Yi had once encountered in the "Lightless Hospital"—the smell of protein and synthetic fibers burning together at high temperatures.

This was the F District Incineration Processing Center.

In this so-called "Perfect City," anything that didn't meet standards, was damaged, or produced "noise" would be transported here, reduced to basic carbon elements, and become the city's nutrients once again.

Lin Yi dragged that heavy high-pressure cleaning gun, moving like a ghost through the shadows of steam pipes.

His palm was still bleeding—the wound left from cutting the neural connection earlier. But he didn't bandage it, didn't even feel that pain. In this world full of false smiles and sweet lies, pain was his only anchor to stay awake.

"Rumble—"

The conveyor belt ahead emitted a dull operational sound.

Lin Yi peeked out to see dozens of "waste products" lying haphazardly on that wide black conveyor belt. Some were scrapped cleaning robots, others were cyborgs with missing limbs.

And in the middle section of the conveyor belt, that familiar figure in gray prisoner-like coveralls was slowly sliding toward the red sea of fire at the end along with the track.

"Su Liang."

Lin Yi's pupils contracted slightly.

Her eyes were tightly closed, her face pale as paper. The data cable behind her head had been roughly torn out, leaving only a broken end exposed, still sparking.

Above her, a massive mechanical sorting claw was slowly descending, seemingly scanning her body to determine whether to incinerate directly or recycle cyborg parts.

"Beep—Organic waste detected. Water content 65%. Recommend direct incineration."

The cold electronic voice pronounced the death sentence.

Lin Yi didn't hesitate. He suddenly rushed out from his hiding place, using the high-pressure cleaning gun in his hand like a javelin, hurling it viciously at the mechanical claw's hydraulic rod.

**Clang!**

The metal gun body, weighing over ten pounds, precisely jammed into the mechanical claw's joint. The mechanical arm emitted a harsh jamming sound, spewing black smoke, and stopped in midair.

## Section 2: Source of Noise

Lin Yi jumped onto the conveyor belt and rushed to Su Liang's side.

"Wake up!"

He yanked Su Liang off the track and dragged her to a nearby maintenance platform.

Su Liang's body was ice cold, like she'd just been pulled from a freezer. Lin Yi noticed her ears—those ears that had been more sensitive than radar in the "Lightless Hospital"—were now bleeding black blood.

"...Noisy... too noisy..."

Su Liang moaned painfully, her eyelashes trembling as she finally opened her eyes.

Those eyes were filled with bloodshot veins and chaos, as if she hadn't yet broken free from the massive data flood.

"Lin Yi?" She recognized the person before her, instinctively wanting to cover her ears. "Here... there are sounds everywhere... they're lying... all the data is lying..."

"I know."

Lin Yi grabbed her wrist, stopping her self-harm, his voice calm and powerful. "Your hearing has evolved. What you're hearing isn't sound anymore—it's this tower's data background noise. The system classified you as a 'malfunction,' so it wants to destroy you."

"Malfunction..."

Su Liang laughed bitterly. She glanced at the still-burning incinerator in the distance. "We're discarded garbage."

"No."

Lin Yi pulled out that [Fragment of Reality] from his pocket, its sharp edge glinting coldly in the firelight.

"Garbage is passively thrown away."

"But we are bombs that actively jumped out."

He pressed the fragment against the back of Su Liang's neck, where residual system signals remained.

"Bear with it. I need to cut your last remaining connection."

**Riiip!**

The fragment sliced through. Su Liang suddenly straightened her spine, letting out a short muffled grunt. As the last trace of blue arc extinguished, the chaos in her eyes gradually faded, and that coldness and sharpness belonging to a veteran returned.

"Huff..."

Su Liang gasped heavily, wiping the blood from her ears. "Thanks. Interest still counts."

"Cut the crap." Lin Yi pulled her up. "Can you walk?"

"Legs are fine." Su Liang stood up, though still somewhat shaky, her gaze was firm. "But we have trouble. I heard... many footsteps. Hard-soled boots, shock batons. Security officers."

## Section 3: Don't Move

Before she finished speaking, alarm lights around the incineration center suddenly blazed.

Red light dyed this space full of steam and dust blood-colored.

"Numbers 89757, 99001!"

An electronically synthesized authoritative voice echoed from all directions. "You have seriously violated the 'Perfect City Security Management Regulations.' Stop resisting immediately, hands on head, kneel and accept formatting!"

"Click-click-click—"

Gates on both sides of the corridor opened.

Two squads of "security officers" in all-black riot armor with smooth mirror faces rushed in. They weren't human, but mass-produced low-level cyborgs. They held buzzing high-voltage shock batons, moving in perfect unison, like a group of black reapers.

"Kneel!!"

The lead security officer roared, his shock baton pointing at Lin Yi.

Su Liang instinctively gripped her dagger tightly, her body tensing. In previous dungeons, facing this number of armed units, their first choice was always to flee or use terrain to maneuver.

But this time, Lin Yi didn't move.

Didn't run either.

He stood at the edge of the maintenance platform, looking down at the security officers surrounding him from below, the corner of his mouth curling into an extremely dangerous cold smile.

"Formatting?"

Lin Yi cracked his neck, making a crisp sound. "The ones that need formatting are you piles of scrap metal."

"Stubborn. Execute coercive measures."

The security officer didn't waste words. Two black-armored guards activated leg hydraulic boosters, jumping onto the platform like cannonballs, their shock batons carrying blue high-voltage arcs, viciously smashing toward Lin Yi's shoulders.

If this hit landed solidly, an ordinary person would instantly go into shock.

Su Liang cried out: "Lin Yi! Dodge!"

But Lin Yi didn't dodge.

He didn't retreat but advanced, facing those two shock batons, suddenly stepping forward.

## Section 4: Aesthetics of Violence

**[Trait Activated: Pain Blocking]**

Lin Yi's pupils dilated in an instant, then locked. Pain nerve transmission signals were forcibly severed.

**Bzzzzt—!!!**

Two shock batons solidly struck Lin Yi's left shoulder and side waist. A million volts of current instantly coursed through his body—you could even smell burning skin.

The security officer's mirror face seemed to flash with data confusion—according to logic, the target should be convulsing on the ground right now.

But Lin Yi didn't move.

He was like a steel sculpture that couldn't feel pain, forcibly withstanding this strike. This behavior completely contrary to biological instinct caused the two AI security officers to experience brief logical lag.

This was the 0.5 seconds Lin Yi wanted.

"Didn't eat breakfast?"

Lin Yi grinned savagely, his left hand suddenly reaching out, ignoring the current's burning, grabbing the security officer's helmet visor.

At the same time, his right hand grasped at empty air.

Data streams flashed.

A pitch-black gun emanating cold metallic luster appeared in his hand—**[P-19 Enforcer Kinetic Pistol]**.

This was the killing weapon he'd purchased for 1200 points before "Eternal Night Train." In that dungeon, he'd never had a chance to use it to maintain his persona, but now, it finally bared its fangs.

"Times have changed, sir."

**Bang!**

Point-blank fire.

The electromagnetically accelerated armor-piercing round instantly pierced the security officer's mirror helmet, exploding into sparks inside that electronic head.

The massive recoil numbed Lin Yi's wrist, but he didn't stop.

Using the gun's recoil, his body spun, the muzzle directly pressed under the second security officer's chin.

**Bang!**

Black engine oil and component fragments sprayed all over Lin Yi.

Two corpses fell almost simultaneously.

Complete silence.

The security officer squad below clearly hadn't seen this kind of "cleaner." In their database, lower-class citizens should be docile, cowardly ants who only knew how to work.

"This... this is impossible..." The lead security officer emitted a garbled exclamation. "This is a gun-free zone! Where did your weapon data come from?!"

Lin Yi stood on the high platform, the black gun muzzle smoking.

His coveralls were already scorched, revealing somewhat blackened skin beneath, but he seemed completely oblivious. Those eyes, under the red alarm lights, burned with fury hotter than the incinerator.

"I am a virus."

Lin Yi raised the gun muzzle, pointing at the bewildered security officers below, coldly spitting out one word:

"Kill."

**Bang! Bang! Bang!**

This wasn't a stealth game.

From this moment on, this was war.
