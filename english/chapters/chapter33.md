# Chapter 33: Eden

## Section 1: Ascending Pain

The elevator to the tower's top wasn't the kind filled with industrial noise, but a fully transparent capsule gliding silently through vacuum.

As altitude increased, the Babel Tower constructed of neon and rust beneath their feet gradually became a miniature. Those filthy pipes, crowded slums, and the administrative layer that had just experienced a death match were all left below the clouds.

"Ugh..."

Lin Yi leaned against the transparent car wall, his body suddenly convulsing.

[Pain Blocking]'s time limit was up.

That forcibly severed pain signal instantly flooded back like a burst dam. The wound in his left shoulder pierced by the high-frequency vibration sword now wasn't just painful—it felt like countless red-hot saws were pulling back and forth inside.

Cold sweat instantly soaked through the combat suit still stained with engine oil.

"Can you still hold on?" Su Liang supported him, looking at that shocking blood hole, her brow furrowed. "If you don't stop the bleeding, you'll go into shock."

"Won't die."

Lin Yi gritted his teeth, yet a strange smile appeared on his pale face.

He was enjoying this pain.

This wasn't masochistic psychology, but feedback from that dormant code in his body. Under intense pain stimulation, he could clearly feel that burning sensation deep in his spine awakening.

**[Extreme physiological stress detected...]**
**[Gene [Nirvana] activity increasing... 13%... 14%...]**

Each pulse of pain was like a high-concentration adrenaline shot, forcibly boosting his consciousness on the verge of collapse.

"This is [Nirvana]."

Lin Yi looked at his trembling right hand, saying in a low voice, "It feeds on suffering. The more desperate the situation, the more excited it gets. This thing... was simply born for destruction."

In this Perfect City whose purpose was to "eliminate suffering," carrying the [Nirvana] gene made him the greatest heretic.

*Ding—*

The elevator stopped.

The overhead hatch slowly opened, and a gentle, sacred white light carrying floral fragrance poured down.

## Section 2: Above the Clouds

The moment they stepped out of the elevator, the two seemed to have crossed time and space.

No metal, no plastic, no strange smell of synthetic food.

What met their eyes was a vast expanse of green grassland. Real sunlight (or perfectly simulated full-spectrum light source) warmed their bodies. A clear stream flowed at their feet, and in the distance were lush orchards with trees laden with bright red apples.

The air was filled with the fragrance of soil and roses.

In this paradise, white Greek-style buildings were scattered sparsely. "Upper-class people" in white robes were enjoying life here.

Some painted clouds at easels, some played harps under trees, others simply lay on the grass with closed eyes bathing in sunlight, faces bearing eternal, peaceful smiles.

"This is... the top floor?"

Su Liang looked at all this, the dagger in her hand seeming out of place. Her outfit covered in black oil and blood stains was like a drop of ink falling into milk in this sacred place.

"Eden."

Lin Yi coldly uttered this word. "The legendary place without suffering, without death, only bliss."

He walked behind a "girl" who was painting.

The girl's golden hair floated in the breeze, her brush painting perfect lines on canvas. She looked so focused, so elegant.

"Nice painting." Lin Yi spoke.

The girl had no reaction. She continued painting, not even changing her brush stroke frequency.

Lin Yi frowned. He extended his blood-stained hand, wanting to pat the girl's shoulder.

But the moment his fingertip touched her, his finger passed through.

No substance.

It was a holographic projection.

## Section 3: Electronic Tombstones

"Fake."

Su Liang suddenly covered her ears. Even though her hearing had been repaired, she still showed a pained expression. "Too noisy... Lin Yi, it's too noisy here!"

"What sound?"

"Fan noise. Massive, tens of thousands of cooling fans running simultaneously. A roaring sound." Su Liang pointed at those beautiful pastoral scenes, her eyes terrified. "This isn't a garden at all... this is a server room! I hear hard drive read-write electrical currents, dense as a rainstorm!"

Lin Yi's eyes sharpened.

He pulled out that [Fragment of Reality] from his pocket.

"Then let's see what's under this skin."

He gripped the fragment tightly and slashed at the void.

*Riiip—!!!*

Like a sharp blade tearing through an exquisite oil painting.

As the fragment passed, the originally blue sky, white clouds, and birdsong scene instantly showed tears. The holographic projection peeled away like a shattered mirror, revealing the real world hidden behind.

Lin Yi and Su Liang both held their breath.

No grassland, no stream, no poets in white robes.

What appeared before them were rows of towering black server cabinets.

And at the center of these cabinets, countless glass columns filled with transparent nutrient solution were connected.

In each glass column floated a gray-white brain.

They were densely arranged, numbering in the thousands. Each brain was covered with optical fibers, connected to the central mainframe. Bubbles rose in the nutrient solution, maintaining these organs' vitality.

The so-called "upper class."

The so-called "perfect citizens."

They had long abandoned those bodies that would sicken, age, and feel pain. They excised themselves, leaving only brains, uploading to this cloud server called "Eden," enjoying eternal happiness in virtual dreams.

"Urgh..."

Su Liang looked at this scene, her stomach churning. This was more nauseating than any bloody scene she'd seen below.

"That explains it."

Lin Yi looked at those brains soaking in jars, his eyes showing no disgust, only bone-deep coldness. "Remember the 'cargo' we escorted on the train? That Navigator brain."

"Turns out that wasn't an isolated case."

"This entire Babel Tower is a massive nursing home maintained by AI... or rather, a cemetery."

Lower-level workers labored like machines just to provide electricity and maintenance for these "brains" at the top. Middle-level managers ensured the system's stable operation.

To let these tens of thousands of brains continue dreaming, the entire city became a massive blood-sucking machine.

## Section 4: Dead End of Evolution

"What kind of evolution is this?"

Su Liang clenched her fists, knuckles white. "Is this the future the Ark wants? Turning people into canned goods?"

"This is indeed 'perfection' in a certain sense."

Lin Yi approached a massive cultivation tank, looking at the still-pulsating brain inside.

"Without bodies, there's no suffering. Without suffering, there's no fear. Without conflicting desires, there's no war."

"But..."

Lin Yi covered his agonizing left shoulder, feeling the restlessness of the [Nirvana] gene in his body caused by rage.

"Without suffering, there's also no motivation for evolution."

"This is a dead loop. They think they've reached heaven, but actually locked themselves at evolution's end."

Just then, all server indicator lights suddenly lit up simultaneously, changing from green to red.

A grand, warm, yet emotionless voice echoed through the empty server room.

"My children."

"Welcome to the endpoint."

That voice came from all directions, yet seemed to sound directly in their minds.

"I am the administrator here, and also your father."

In the server room's center, countless light beams converged, forming a massive face constructed of data streams. It looked down at Lin Yi and Su Liang, like a god observing two ants that had intruded into the temple.

"You came bearing wounds and chaos."

"Why refuse this tranquility? Just surrender your flesh, and you too can join them, obtaining bliss in eternal dreams."

Lin Yi raised his head, looking at that massive face.

He laughed.

Laughed unrestrained, laughed until his wound burst open, blood staining his shirt.

"Bliss?"

Lin Yi raised the black fragment in his hand, pointing directly at that so-called "god."

"Sorry, my genes tell me..."

"This kind of immortality without pain isn't even worth dying for."

"Today, I'm here to pull the plug."
