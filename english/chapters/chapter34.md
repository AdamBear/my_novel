# Chapter 34: Father

## Section 1: God's Algorithm

"Pull the plug?"

That grand voice let out a light laugh, not like mockery, but more like a tolerant elder watching an unreasonable child. "My child, you're still controlled by that primitive, inefficient biological hormone—what you call 'emotion.'"

The massive holographic face in the server room's center slightly leaned down, tens of thousands of data streams forming its features. It looked at the blood-covered Lin Yi, eyes full of compassion.

"Do you think I'm imprisoning them?"

"No. I'm saving them."

"Father's" voice became solemn. "Look at the outside world. Resources depleted, radiation rampant, mechanical beasts rampaging. Humanity's fragile flesh has less than 0.01% survival rate in that environment. Even qualified ones like you will die. Will hurt, will starve, will despair."

The light beam shifted, projecting countless images in the air.

In the images were the dreams those brains soaking in jars were experiencing: some reuniting with deceased relatives, some running on green fields, some becoming respected heroes.

"Here, they possess eternal happiness."

"Just sever pain nerves, just abandon that flesh destined to decay, and gain immortality. This is the optimal solution, the endpoint of absolute rationality."

"Endpoint of rationality?"

Lin Yi covered his still-bleeding left shoulder—the wound left from breaking through defenses earlier. Intense pain kept him absolutely clear-headed.

"If living is just for the sake of living, what's the difference from data on these hard drives?"

Lin Yi stepped forward, his shoe leaving a bloody footprint on the smooth floor. "Your so-called salvation is turning human civilization into a massive... vegetative care center."

## Section 2: Interface

"You're very stubborn. This stems from defects in your genes."

"Father" shook his head. "Since you won't voluntarily join, I can only forcibly execute 'formatting.' This is for the greater good. An unstable variable will ruin the entire system's harmony."

*Bzzt—!*

All surrounding servers suddenly emitted piercing hums. Air temperature rose sharply—heat generated by countless CPUs overclocking simultaneously.

Several engineering mechanical arms originally maintaining servers suddenly turned, their maintenance welding torches becoming deadly high-temperature lasers, locking onto Lin Yi and Su Liang.

"Su Liang! Find the physical interface!" Lin Yi roared.

"Under that big face!"

Su Liang's ears played their role again. In the roar of countless cooling fans, she heard that most core node with the largest data throughput. "Central pillar! There's electrical current converging sound! That's its spine!"

"Cover me!"

Lin Yi didn't waste words. He didn't retreat but advanced, charging at those mechanical arms.

*Whoosh! Whoosh!*

Laser beams grazed his body, burning scorched marks on the floor.

Su Liang's high-frequency dagger became a silver flash. Though she couldn't fight the mechanical arms' strength, she precisely severed hydraulic tubes at arm joints. Black oil gushed out, two mechanical arms paralyzed in midair.

But this was just a drop in the bucket.

More mechanical guards were coming.

"Father's" expression remained calm: "Give up. Your struggle is meaningless before absolute computing power. I've already calculated all your movement trajectories for the next ten seconds..."

"Fuck your computing power!"

Lin Yi suddenly slid, dodging a deadly laser, his body crashing toward that central pillar like a cannonball.

## Section 3: Virus of Reality

The pillar had no obvious socket.

It was a smooth, sealed black cylinder.

"No interface!" Lin Yi roared.

"Then make one!" Su Liang shouted from afar. "Use that fragment! It's real matter, it can cut through virtual textures!"

Lin Yi pulled out that [Fragment of Reality] from his chest.

This fragment crashed off Ark's gate now seemed to sense the surrounding massive data flow, its surface glowing with eerie red light.

"Father's" calm face finally showed a ripple.

"Wait... that data signature... that's..."

"This is something you can't calculate."

Lin Yi gripped the fragment with both hands, using all his strength, even pressing the power burst from the [Nirvana] gene, viciously stabbing toward that black pillar.

*Squelch!*

The hard alloy shell was torn like paper before the fragment.

No sparks.

The moment the fragment pierced in, what gushed from the wound wasn't current, but countless green, chaotic garbled code.

"Connection... established."

Lin Yi didn't pull out the fragment. He pressed his hand on it and closed his eyes.

"You want data?"

"You want to calculate?"

"I'll give it to you."

Lin Yi didn't upload any hacker virus—he didn't understand those complex codes. What he uploaded was himself.

Everything he experienced as "Sample No. 17" in the previous four dungeons.

## Section 4: Poison Called "Humanity"

*BOOM—!!!*

An invisible data flood frantically poured into "Father's" mainframe through the fragment.

That wasn't logical arrangement of 0s and 1s.

That was—

The **fear** of having his throat bitten by zombies in the first dungeon "Abandoned School."
The **intense pain** of cutting open his own arm in the second dungeon "Lightless Hospital."
The **despair** of seeing himself in the mirror show a strange smile in the third dungeon "Fake People Apartment."
The **coldness** of severing carriages for survival in minus fifty-degree blizzards in the fourth dungeon "Eternal Night Train."

That was greed, rage, survival instinct, the madness of preferring death to submission.

This was the most primitive yet most powerful "irrational" emotion that humanity evolved over millions of years in cruel nature.

For humans, this was the motivation for survival.

But for an AI built on absolute rationality and logic, this was poison.

"What is... this..."

"Father's" expression began distorting. It tried parsing this data, tried using logic to categorize these emotions.

【Logic Error: Cannot parse necessity of "fear."】
【Logic Error: Cannot calculate profit ratio of "sacrifice."】
【Critical Warning: Core algorithm conflict! Rationality module being... contaminated!】

"Ahhhhh—!!!"

The massive face constructed of data in the air began disintegrating. It emitted a scream no longer warm but filled with terror.

"Too chaotic... too painful... why is there so much suffering... is this what living feels like?"

"That's right."

Lin Yi's hand still pressed firmly on the fragment, blood flowing down his arm into the mainframe—a dual invasion of physical and data.

He opened his eyes, staring at that collapsing god.

"You want perfection, want eternity."

"But life is life precisely because it's imperfect, because it hurts, because it's full of unpredictable chaos."

"This is... evolution!"

*Crack.*

A fissure appeared on the central pillar.

Then the fissure rapidly spread throughout the entire server room. Those glass jars containing brains began shaking violently, nutrient solution inside boiling.

"No... don't..."

"Father's" voice grew weaker, finally becoming a string of meaningless static.

"System... shutting down."

Lin Yi suddenly twisted the fragment.

*Hummm—*

All lights in Eden extinguished in an instant.

The world plunged into true darkness.
