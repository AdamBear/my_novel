# Chapter 21: Fragment of Reality

## Section 1: Static from Underground

The pure white teleportation light finally dissipated, and the nauseating pink sweet scent from the fake people apartment was replaced by the cold, clean air unique to the transit station. Lin Yi breathed deeply, the exhaustion of surviving a disaster making him not want to move a single finger. As the system's mechanical voice fell, two green light pillars enveloped him and Su Liang. The blood holes pierced by tentacles and the skin torn by mirrors were healing at a visible rate, the tingling itch replacing the intense pain. Logically, this should be the most relaxing moment, but Lin Yi keenly sensed something was wrong. Su Liang hadn't stood up. She knelt on the ground, both hands pressing hard against her temples, brow furrowed, her expression even more pained than when encountering high-frequency noise in the dungeon. Cold sweat slid down her pale cheeks, dripping onto the pure white floor. Lin Yi frowned and reached out to pat her, thinking the repair program had malfunctioned, but Su Liang suddenly swatted his hand away. Don't make noise, she said in a low voice, trembling, her whole body leaning forward as if desperately trying to capture some extremely weak signal in the air—so weak it almost didn't exist.

Can't you hear it, Su Liang turned her head, her eyes filled with terror and confusion. Lin Yi looked around. Aside from the constant electrical hum of the system on standby, this space was silent as death. No, not the system, Su Liang's knuckles turned white from pressing her temples so hard, it's a layer of background noise, just below the system's broadcast frequency, very deep, like in the deep sea, it's a radio wave band. Radio, Lin Yi was stunned. In this fully digitized quantum system, in this virtual space constructed of code, how could there be this kind of old-era analog signal. *Crackle, crackle,* this is Ash Outpost, Su Liang intermittently repeated what she was hearing, speaking extremely fast, as if the sounds would slip away like sand through fingers if she didn't speak immediately. Seventh call to the Ark, please respond if you receive this, our defense line has been breached by Titans, requesting fire coverage. This is the last frequency, you bastards in the greenhouse, how long will you keep hiding.

The voice cut off abruptly. Su Liang gasped heavily, her whole body collapsing limply, staring ahead with empty eyes. The transit station fell into an even deeper silence. Lin Yi looked at Su Liang, his expression shifting from confusion to shock, finally settling into a bottomless chill. That definitely wasn't dungeon plot. Fake people would only talk about perfection and fusion, never speak words full of gunpowder like Ash Outpost. That voice was filled with exhaustion, despair, and real electrical static—it was a voice from outside, from that real world the Observer called the wasteland. Ark, greenhouse, Lin Yi murmured, his mind conjuring the image of that massive dome he'd seen at the end of the last dungeon, and beyond the dome, the endless yellow sand and mechanical beasts. It seems this wall is thinner than we imagined, Lin Yi stood up, his gaze seeming to penetrate the void of white above, seeing that burning world outside. This might be your evolution, Lin Yi analyzed calmly, your hearing is no longer limited to physical vibrations, you're starting to receive signals, this might be our only clue to finding an exit in the future.

## Section 2: Unparseable Code

After calming their emotions, the two began settling their spoils. Numbers that made their hearts race jumped on the panel: 800 points for basic survival, 1500 point bonus for killing the mother body, plus previous balance—Lin Yi's total points soared to 4200. This was a fortune, but Lin Yi felt no joy, because the difficulty was rising exponentially. From zombies to invisible monsters to mentally controlling fake people—if he didn't want to die, this money had to be immediately converted into combat power. He turned his gaze to the special drop brought out from the dungeon—the Fragment of Reality. It was an irregular black mirror shard the size of a palm, with extremely sharp edges, yet light as a feather in his hand. But the strangest thing about this mirror was that it didn't reflect. Lin Yi held it up to Su Liang, and instead of Su Liang's reflection appearing on the mirror surface, a stream of green, frantically jumping code appeared.

Entity: Sample-99...
Status: Organic/Enhanced...
Trust Level: 85%...

The characters flowed like a waterfall, displaying Su Liang's organic state and enhancement parameters. This thing can parse the essence of data, Lin Yi thoughtfully turned the shard toward his own hand, watching as the shard no longer showed skin but red muscle fibers and white skeletal data models, along with that glaring [Nirvana] gene marker. In the fake people dungeon it could reveal the true form of fake people, and elsewhere, it might help us see through the system's disguise textures. Good stuff, Lin Yi carefully tucked it into his inner pocket. The system notes indicated it would never lie and could be used to break through mid-level and below illusions—definitely a trump card that could save lives at critical moments.

## Section 3: The Cost of War

Next was the enhancement phase. Lin Yi opened the shop, his gaze skipping past cold weapons and locking directly onto the firearms and protection sections. The next one is three-and-a-half star difficulty. Based on the system's nature, monster strength will upgrade again. Relying purely on axes and scalpels has too low a margin for error. Without hesitation, he paid 1200 points to exchange for a P-19 Enforcer model kinetic pistol. This gun fired electromagnetically accelerated live rounds with extremely high penetration against carbon-based and light-armored units, and came with two boxes of armor-piercing rounds. Then he spent another 800 points purchasing a set of polar tactical clothing with temperature control modules. Su Liang looked at the cold-gleaming black pistol in Lin Yi's hand and raised an eyebrow. Upgraded your arsenal, actually willing to buy a gun.

Lin Yi skillfully checked the magazine, chambered a round, his movements fluid, his gaze cold. To deal with worse situations, he said, if we encounter another veteran like that scarred face, or certain non-biological enemies, like machines, cold weapons won't work. The two were fully equipped. The originally thin hospital gowns and casual wear were gone, replaced by sleek black tactical gear—stab-proof vests, tactical belts, plus Lin Yi's gun and Su Liang's new high-frequency vibration dagger hidden in her sleeve. Standing in the pure white space, they finally no longer looked like lambs waiting for slaughter, but more like two freshly sharpened blades, ready to cut through this false trial.

## Section 4: Roar in the Eternal Night

Rest time ended. The Observer's voice sounded on schedule, and this time, its tone seemed to carry a barely perceptible anticipation. Sample No. 17, Sample No. 99, you have proven you possess the ability to find truth within lies. Now, we will test your survival resilience in the face of absolute violence. Loading Fourth Dungeon, difficulty level three-and-a-half stars, tagged as faction confrontation, extreme cold survival, mechanical frenzy. With the notification sound, the surrounding temperature began to plummet. The originally temperature-controlled transit station instantly became cold as an ice cellar. Lin Yi's breath instantly turned to white mist. Faction confrontation, Su Liang keenly caught this term, we're going to fight living people. Not just living people, Lin Yi gripped the kinetic pistol in his hand, feeling that real metallic texture, but also machines, did you hear.

*Rumble, rumble.* Before the teleportation white light completely swallowed them, a dull, extremely rhythmic vibration sound had already transmitted over. It was the sound of steel giant wheels crushing frozen earth, the sound of thousands of tons of metal roaring. The white light flashed, intense weightlessness struck. When Lin Yi opened his eyes again, the first thing he felt wasn't light, but wind. Wind sharp as knives, mixed with ice shards, lashing viciously at his face, instantly stripping away his body's surface temperature. He was lying prone on top of a massive, high-speed moving metal object. Above was a pitch-black eternal night sky without stars, and beneath him was an endlessly long black armored train, like a steel python, racing madly across the vast white snowfield. In the deepest darkness, countless red electronic eyes were lighting up, accompanied by the screeching of metal friction, rushing toward the train. Lin Yi released the safety, coldly telling himself, welcome to the battlefield.
