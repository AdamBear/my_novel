# Chapter 4: Loop and Evolution

## Section 1: Phantom Pain and Reasoning

"Whoosh—!!"

Lin Yi shot up from the ground like a drowning person suddenly surfacing.

He gasped for air. His hands frantically felt his throat and shoulder.

"Ah... ha... it hurts... hurts..."

No wounds.

His skin was perfectly fine. Even the bloody hole from the wire was gone.

But he could still clearly feel the tearing pain, like phantom limb pain. It remained in his nerve endings, making his whole body shake uncontrollably.

Cold sweat instantly soaked his clothes and dripped from his forehead onto the floor.

Lin Yi looked around in terror.

Still that broken classroom. Still that peeling ceiling. The sunlight was still pale. The wind still moaned.

Everything had returned to the starting point.

*Buzz.*

The virtual interface popped up automatically. The cold text felt like mockery:

[Status]
Health: 100/100
Mental Points: 85/100 (Death penalty: -15 points)

[System Warning]
Player's first death detected.
Current trigger mechanism: Death loop.
Warning: Mental Points zero = permanent consciousness erasure.

"Permanent erasure..."

Lin Yi stared at that line of blood-red text. His teeth ground together.

Those hellish few minutes had completely destroyed his worldview. That wasn't a "Game Over" from a game. That was a real death experience. If his mental points reached zero, if he didn't complete the mission... he would really die.

"I don't want to die... I don't want to experience that feeling again..."

Fear wrapped around his heart like a poisonous snake.

But as a former expert player, Lin Yi's mental strength was better than most people's. After the initial breakdown, his survival instinct forced him to calm down.

He slapped himself hard to stop the shaking.

"Stay calm. Since it resets, that means there's a pattern to follow."

Lin Yi's brain started racing, trying to use logic to fight fear.

"This is like 'Re:Zero' or 'Edge of Tomorrow.' Death is painful, but I have my memories. I know what will happen in the future."

He stood up. The fear in his eyes was gradually replaced by determination.

"I know that lockpicking monster is at the end of the hallway. I know the library is a trap. I know they work together."

"As long as I avoid that trap, as long as I use the information advantage I have..."

"I can win."

At this moment, Lin Yi thought he had the key to winning—**memory advantage**.

But he didn't know that in this trial, "memory" was sometimes the deadliest trap.

## Section 2: Prey's Struggle

This time, Lin Yi didn't swagger around like before.

He became very careful.

He didn't take that heavy fire axe because he realized that although it was powerful, it was too clumsy and made noise when picked up.

He removed a steel leg from a desk and weighed it in his hand.

"Light, hidden, good enough."

Lin Yi quietly crept to the classroom door. He didn't go out right away. Instead, he lay on the ground and observed the hallway through the door crack.

According to his memory, the first zombie should stumble over from the stairway.

"When it walks to the middle, I'll sneak attack from behind. One-hit kill."

Lin Yi calculated the distance and timing in his mind.

However, one minute passed.

Two minutes passed.

The hallway was empty. That zombie didn't appear.

"What's going on? Did the spawn point change?" Lin Yi frowned. The uneasy feeling rose in his heart again.

He waited patiently a bit longer. After confirming it was safe, he carefully pushed open the door and slipped into the hallway.

The stairway was quiet.

Lin Yi pressed against the wall and moved toward the stairway step by step. He stayed alert in all directions, afraid something would suddenly rush out.

But he forgot one thing... **above**.

When he reached the stair corner, a stinking wind suddenly attacked from overhead.

No footsteps. No warning.

Lin Yi instinctively looked up.

That one glance terrified him.

The zombie that should have been walking on the ground was now clinging to the ceiling pipes with all four limbs spread out, like a giant gecko!

Its head was twisted 180 degrees. That one eye was staring at Lin Yi below.

"It's above?!"

*Whoosh—!*

The zombie released its grip and dropped like a cannonball using gravity.

Lin Yi rolled to the side in panic. Although he avoided getting his neck crushed directly, the zombie's landing shockwave still made his ears ring. Before he could get up, the zombie had already bounced off the ground and swung its claws at his face.

"Get away!"

Lin Yi swung the steel leg and smashed it hard on the zombie's arm.

But this zombie's strength was twice as strong as the last round! The steel pipe hitting it was like hitting a tire. The recoil force split Lin Yi's palm open.

"This is wrong! How did its stats increase?!"

Lin Yi discovered in horror that not only had the position changed, but this monster's speed, strength, and reaction nerves had all improved by a level.

This wasn't a reset. This was clearly **dynamic difficulty evolution**!

Lin Yi didn't dare fight. He turned and ran toward the second floor.

"Since there's an ambush here, I'll go to open ground! To the playground!"

He rushed down the stairs but suddenly stopped on the second-floor landing.

Because he saw a scene of despair.

In the second-floor hallway stood three zombies.

They weren't wandering. They weren't spacing out. They held removed table legs, sharpened steel pipes, and one even held a manhole cover as a shield.

They were neatly arranged in a fan shape, blocking all paths to the first floor.

They were in **formation**.

When they saw Lin Yi rush down, the middle zombie holding a steel pipe actually raised its hand, pointed at Lin Yi, and made a short low growl from its throat.

*Roar.*

With this command, the left and right zombies flanked to the sides while the middle one advanced with its weapon.

"Tactical coordination... even a commander..."

Lin Yi's hand holding the steel pipe trembled violently.

He finally understood.

This wasn't some rigid game program. The Observer's so-called "adaptive evolution" meant the AI would read his death data from the last round.

He used sound in the last round, so this round the zombies learned to be silent.

He used terrain to trap monsters in the last round, so this round the zombies learned to flank and ambush.

He died from overconfidence in the last round, so this round the zombies learned to go all out.

His memory advantage was a joke in front of the evolving AI.

It was like an elementary school student with a strategy guide suddenly discovering the test had changed to advanced math problems.

"I don't want to play anymore... let me out..."

Lin Yi backed up step by step until his back pressed against the cold wall.

Tactical squad ahead. Pursuers behind.

The zombie that jumped from the ceiling had also caught up, blocking his escape route.

Surrounded on all sides.

The zombies didn't rush to attack. They slowly tightened the circle. Their weapons tapped the ground, making a heart-stopping rhythm.

It was death's countdown.

A few seconds later, desperate screams erupted in the hallway again.

Only this time, it was shorter and more miserable than before.

*[Observation Record - Sample 17]*

*Time: 17 minutes 42 seconds after mission start*

*Status: Death (second time).*

*Cause of death: Multiple fractures/beaten to death.*

*Observer Notes:*

*AI evolution speed as expected. Sample's attempt to rely on "empiricism" strategy completely failed.*

*Despair index has reached critical value.*

*This is good. Only in complete despair can the seed of [rebirth] possibly sprout.*

*Continue reset.*
