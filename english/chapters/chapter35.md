# Chapter 35: Long Live Chaos

## Section 1: Dream in a Jar

As "Father's" final wail disappeared, all lights in Eden extinguished, and the world plunged into brief deathly silence.

But after just three seconds, a sound more chilling than any alarm erupted from the darkness.

*Gurgle... gurgle...*

That was the sound of nutrient solution in thousands of cultivation tanks simultaneously boiling.

Then came the crisp sound of glass impacts. Those "perfect brains" severed from virtual connections and forcibly yanked from beautiful dreams back to reality were now experiencing true hell. Having lost the central AI's comfort and sensory shielding, their fragile nerves were instantly exposed directly to air vibrations and electrical static.

They were screaming.

Though they had no vocal cords, the brainwave chaos from thousands of brains simultaneously erupting formed an invisible mental storm that swept through the entire server room.

"Ugh..." Su Liang clutched her head, painfully collapsing to her knees. "So noisy... they're shouting pain... they're shouting for help..."

"Don't listen."

Lin Yi pulled out the fragment stuck in the pillar. The fragment was no longer glowing red, but had become ice cold.

"When dreams end, of course it hurts."

*Crack!*

The cultivation tank nearest them suddenly exploded. That gray-white brain fell to the ground, convulsing violently twice like a fish out of water, then rapidly blackened and died.

This was like a signal.

*Crack! Crack! Crack!*

Countless tanks exploded in succession. Pink nutrient solution flowed everywhere, the air instantly filled with that sickeningly sweet fishy smell.

## Section 2: Gravity Returns

*RUMBLE—!!!*

The floor beneath their feet suddenly tilted thirty degrees. Lin Yi grabbed the railing, barely avoiding sliding into that pile of rotting brains.

"What's happening?!" Su Liang shouted in terror.

"Gravity."

Lin Yi looked at the steel beams overhead that were breaking, his gaze terrifyingly calm. "This Babel Tower is too tall. Without AI-controlled anti-gravity fields and structural balance algorithms, it can't support its own weight."

Now, the algorithms were gone.

Physical laws had retaken control of everything.

Through the shattered dome, a magnificent scene of destruction was visible:

In the tower's mid-section, B District administrative layer's load-bearing columns were snapping like cookies. Massive metal plates peeled off, crashing down onto the prosperous C District commercial street below.

Those flying cars that had been orderly shuttling through the air lost navigation signals, crashing into skyscrapers like headless flies, exploding into brilliant fireballs.

And in the lowest F District, those workers who had labored like ants day after day—the red directive light in their eyes extinguished. They looked up in confusion at the sky collapsing overhead, for the first time emitting human, fearful screams.

Perfect order completely collapsed in this moment.

"Chaos."

Lin Yi watched all this, the corner of his mouth curling into a mad smile. "This is what the world should be."

## Section 3: No Escape

"Stop philosophizing! We're going to die!"

Su Liang pointed behind them. The elevator shaft leading to ground level had become a chimney spewing flames, explosion shockwaves surging up the shaft.

The only exit was sealed.

The platform beneath their feet was shaking violently, emitting unbearable metal twisting sounds. According to Lin Yi's judgment, at most half a minute before this entire top-floor server room would fall like building blocks.

"Is there a way out?" Su Liang gripped her dagger tightly, though she knew this blade was useless now. "You're not planning to have us buried with these brains, are you?"

"Of course not."

Lin Yi turned around, looking toward the server room's edge.

Originally there was a holographically projected "Eden cliff," but now with the hologram gone, it had become a real precipice.

Beyond the cliff was a bottomless abyss, continuously exploding firelight, the disintegrating city ruins.

Gale winds howled, carrying thick smoke and sparks, making it almost impossible to open their eyes.

"There." Lin Yi pointed at a massive black object falling about five hundred meters below the cliff. "That's the B District administrative hall wreckage. Its cushioning airbags deployed."

"So?" Su Liang's eyes widened. "You want to jump over? That's five hundred meters! And it's also falling!"

"This is the only springboard."

Lin Yi grabbed Su Liang, looking into her eyes. "Remember what I said at the transit station?"

"What?"

"Next stop, we're going to kill our way through this game." Lin Yi's face showed that familiar yet frightening gambler's fervor. "If we don't put ourselves in mortal danger, how can we kill through?"

## Section 4: System Error

*Crack!*

The last main beam beneath their feet snapped. The top platform began free-falling.

No time to hesitate.

"Trust me!"

Lin Yi roared, no longer giving Su Liang time to think. He tightly embraced Su Liang's waist, and the moment the platform completely disintegrated, leaped toward that chaotic, dark abyss filled with the breath of death.

*Whoosh—!*

Intense weightlessness instantly enveloped their entire bodies.

Wind roared in their ears, the world spinning before their eyes.

In this extreme descent, Lin Yi didn't close his eyes. He stared fixedly at that collapsing Babel Tower symbolizing absolute order, watching it turn to ruins in flames.

He won.

Using the most extreme, most insane method, he proved perfection's fragility.

And in that descending endless darkness, a faint line of code no longer system blue but eerie green flashed across his retina:

**【System Error: Nirvana Project - Subject 17 is out of control.】**

**【Warning: Cannot recover. Initiating forced isolation program...】**
**【Target redirected: Prison Zero.】**

Darkness swallowed everything.

**【Fifth Dungeon: Perfect City (Complete)】**
**【Current Status: Sample No. 17】**
**【Mental Value: 95/100】**(Extreme pleasure from destruction overwhelmed fear)
**【Gene [Nirvana] Unlock Rate: 25%】**
**【Ending】: Babel Tower fallen, sample out of control.**
