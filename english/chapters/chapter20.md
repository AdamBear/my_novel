# Chapter 20: Mother Body

## Section 1: The Pink Breeding Ground

Pushing open the iron door with the 【Property Management Office】 sign, a wave of warm, humid, and sickeningly sweet pink mist rushed toward them.

This wasn't an office at all.

This was a massive nest constructed from countless mirrors and chunks of flesh.

The four walls, ceiling, and floor of the room were completely covered with mirror fragments of all sizes. And in the center of the room floated a gigantic meat ball over three meters in diameter.

It was like a heart, slowly pulsating.

*Thump... thump...*

With each pulse, hundreds of black cables connected to it transmitted bursts of pink flowing light, which traveled along the cables to the mirrors on the walls, then transmitted through the mirror network to every corner of the apartment.

And on the surface of that meat ball, densely packed human faces grew.

Auntie Wang, Uncle Li, the tattooed man... even the countless "Lin Yis" and "Su Liangs" they'd seen on the rooftop.

These faces all had their eyes closed, wearing expressions of extreme satisfaction and serenity, as if immersed in a beautiful dream from which they'd never wake.

"Welcome home..."

The meat ball writhed, emitting countless overlapping voices. The voice was so gentle it could make one cry, like a mother's whisper to a fetus in the womb.

"Look, there's no pain here, no hunger, and no separation."

"All consciousness merges together... we are perfect."

Lin Yi felt his eyelids growing heavier and heavier.

That pink light seemed to carry some kind of hypnotic frequency. Looking at that meat ball, the killing intent in his heart was rapidly fading, replaced by a strong impulse to walk over, merge with it, and become part of it.

【Warning: Subjected to high-intensity mental pollution】
【Current mental value: 55/100... 50/100...】

The value was plummeting.

"Lin Yi! Don't look!"

Su Liang behind him suddenly screamed. She slammed into Lin Yi's back, making him stumble.

"Its light is poisonous! It's a virus transmitted through the optic nerve!"

## Section 2: Blind Trust

Lin Yi bit through the tip of his tongue. The intense pain brought back a trace of clarity.

"Can't look..."

He realized that this Boss's attack method wasn't physical, but cognitive. Just by looking at it, the brain would be "assimilated."

In this room full of mirrors, there was nowhere to hide.

"Close your eyes!"

Lin Yi roared, then tightly shut his eyes.

The world plunged into darkness.

But with the closing of vision, the desire to be assimilated instantly weakened.

"Su Liang, you close your eyes too! Don't look at it!"

"I've closed them!" Su Liang's voice trembled. "But how do we fight with our eyes closed? It's surrounded by tentacles—those are physical attacks!"

Lin Yi gripped the fruit knife and mirror shard in his hands.

At this moment, he had become blind. In this nest full of tentacles and mental pollution, a blind person was a lamb waiting for slaughter.

Unless... he had a pair of eyes.

A pair of eyes that didn't need to open.

"Su Liang."

Lin Yi's voice was unusually calm amid the chaotic humming. "Are your ears working?"

"...Yes."

"Then be my eyes."

Lin Yi assumed a combat stance, facing that unknown darkness. "Whether it's tentacles or that rotten meat, call out the positions. I'll kill it."

This was a huge gamble.

He was putting his life in the hands of a woman who had wanted to kill him not long ago. If Su Liang called out 0.1 seconds too slow, or was off by half an inch, he'd be skewered.

"Heh... the debtor sure is demanding."

Su Liang took a deep breath. In that moment, her hearing fully opened.

In her world, that disgusting meat ball was no longer a visual image, but became countless precise sound sources. The contraction of muscles, the whoosh of tentacles cutting through air, the beating of the core...

"Three o'clock direction, duck!"

Lin Yi didn't hesitate for a moment, instantly crouching.

*Whoosh!*

A thick tentacle swept past his scalp and smashed into the mirror behind him, shattering it across the floor.

"Twelve o'clock direction, thrust straight! Distance two meters!"

Lin Yi suddenly stepped forward, the fruit knife in his hand stabbing out viciously.

*Squelch!*

The sensation of blade entering flesh. A shrill scream came from ahead.

"Hit!"

Lin Yi's heart leaped with joy.

"Don't stop! Nine o'clock, backstep!"

"Six o'clock, jump!"

"One o'clock, swing the blade!"

In this nest filled with the breath of death, the two performed a thrilling duet.

Su Liang's voice was rapid and precise, Lin Yi's movements sharp and decisive.

If it were an ordinary person, reacting to a command would take at least 0.5 seconds. But Lin Yi was a freak who had unlocked the [Nirvana] gene—his neural response speed had long surpassed normal humans.

Between him and Su Liang, it was as if an invisible data cable connected them.

You are the ears, I am the hands.

We are accomplices.

## Section 3: The Logic of Utopia

"Ahhh—why resist?!"

The mother body let out an angry roar. It couldn't understand why these two humans would refuse such perfect fusion.

"Isn't pain bad? Existing as individuals... is lonely!"

With its roar, all the mirrors in the room began to shake violently.

"Watch out! It's charging up a big move!"

Su Liang's voice suddenly became sharp. "Its core frequency is rising! It's going to detonate a mental shock!"

Lin Yi felt his brain being stabbed with needles.

"Where's the core?" Lin Yi shouted through gritted teeth.

"Dead center! Height one and a half meters! But... there are three layers of meat shields blocking it!"

"No time!"

Lin Yi made a crazy decision.

He would no longer dodge.

"Su Liang, give me a straight path!"

"Are you insane? There are tentacles all over the front!"

"I just need the path!"

0.1 seconds of silence.

"Straight ahead! Charge!" Su Liang roared.

Lin Yi exploded forward. He no longer cared about the whistling sounds coming at him, no longer cared about the wounds being carved into his body. Like a cannonball, he charged straight toward that sound source in the darkness.

*Squelch!*

A tentacle pierced through his left shoulder.

Lin Yi grunted, but his speed didn't decrease—it increased. Using the tentacle's pulling force, he suddenly lunged forward.

*Squelch!*

Another tentacle stabbed through his thigh.

Lin Yi stumbled, blood gushing wildly, but he still didn't stop.

Pain.

Intense pain.

But this pain kept him incredibly clear-headed. The mother body's mental control became pale and powerless in the face of extreme physical suffering.

"Only pain... is real!"

Lin Yi roared, and relying on his memory of that giant meat ball's outline, gripped the sharpest mirror shard with both hands in reverse grip and stabbed it in viciously.

At this position!

This beating sound!

*Splurt—!*

The shard went in to the hilt.

It didn't feel like stabbing into flesh, but like stabbing into a high-speed running mainframe.

*Bzzzzt—!!!*

A piercing electrical current sound exploded.

The mother body's scream instantly turned into some kind of garbled electronic noise.

"Error... logic error..."

"Virus detected... independent consciousness incompatible..."

"System... collap... sing..."

## Section 4: Survivorship Bias

*BOOM—!*

The giant meat ball began to collapse and dissolve. The cables connected to the walls snapped one after another, the pink light rapidly dimmed, turning into a deathly gray-white.

Lin Yi felt the pressure on his body lighten.

He pulled out the shard, gasping heavily, and slowly opened his eyes.

The scene before him was shattering.

The chunks of flesh, the mirrors, even the walls of the entire apartment—all were decomposing like data streams, transforming into countless green codes that scattered in the air.

That warm living room, that harmonious courtyard, that terrifying property management office...

All disappeared.

Only a void of darkness remained, and two people floating in that darkness.

"Is it over?"

Su Liang covered her ears, looking around somewhat incredulously.

"It's over."

Lin Yi pulled out the tentacle stuck in his shoulder—the tentacle also turned into code the instant it left his body. The wound was still bleeding, but was healing at a visible rate.

【Congratulations on clearing: Third Dungeon - Apartment No. 404 of Fake People】
【Time taken: 26 hours】
【Survivors: 2/6】
【Boss killed: Mother Body (Utopia AI·Beta Version)】

With the system notification sound, a yellowed photograph floated down, landing right in Lin Yi's hand.

By the faint light, Lin Yi made out the photograph's contents.

It was a group photo.

The background was this very Apartment 404, but back then it was still a brand-new building, with a banner hanging:

【"Human Instrumentality Project" 77th Psychological Stress Test Group - Launch Ceremony】

The people in the photo were Auntie Wang, Uncle Li, the tattooed man... They were all wearing researchers' white lab coats, smiling happily.

And on the back of the photo was a line of scrawled writing:

"If we cannot defeat the monsters outside, then let us achieve eternal life in the virtual world. —This too is a form of continuation."

Lin Yi looked at the photograph in silence for a long time.

So the so-called fake people were nothing more than the product of those humans who escaped reality years ago, uploading their consciousness, only to be assimilated by an AI that had undergone logic mutation due to lack of maintenance.

They wanted to create heaven.

In the end, they created a man-eating hell.

"Pathetic creatures."

Lin Yi coldly commented, relaxing his palm and letting the photograph dissolve into data.

"Those who flee from pain will ultimately be devoured by pain."

White light descended.

Teleportation began.
