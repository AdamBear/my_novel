# Chapter 25: Wetware CPU

## Section 1: Pink Tears

With the rear carriages abandoned, the train's speed noticeably increased, like a steel beast that had shed its burden, roaring madly across the eternal night's ice field. The air pressure in Carriage Nine finally stabilized, the heating system resumed operation, gradually dispelling that bone-piercing cold. But the air wasn't filled with the relief of survival—instead, a suffocating silence more oppressive than the cold itself. The bespectacled doctor (Sample No. 105) sat slumped in the corner, arms wrapped around his knees, staring blankly at the bloodstains on the floor, still neurotically muttering about those abandoned people. The mercenary was wiping engine oil from his rifle, his expression grim. Su Liang leaned against the container, eyes closed in meditation, but the dagger in her hand never returned to its sheath. Lin Yi stood by the observation window, watching the darkness racing past outside, his heart unmoved. For him, the decision just made was simply the optimal solution, nothing more.

*Drip. Drip.*

An extremely faint dripping sound broke the silence. In this carriage full of mechanical noise, this sound was particularly jarring. Su Liang's ears twitched, and she suddenly opened her eyes, her gaze locking onto the huge black container in the center of the carriage. "The box is leaking." Su Liang said coldly. Lin Yi immediately went over to check. Sure enough, from the gap at the container's bottom, a pool of pink viscous liquid had seeped out. The liquid carried a strange sweet fragrance, like strawberry-flavored nutrient solution, yet also like some creature's bodily fluid, completely out of place in the rough industrial environment. "Mechanic!" Lin Yi called out in a low voice. "Come look. Did the vibration damage the cooling system?" The short mechanic tremblingly crawled over and began checking with his tools. "The shell... the shell cracked." The mechanic wiped cold sweat from his forehead. "The vibration during decoupling was too strong, plus the earlier gunfight, the shock absorption layer failed. If we don't fix it, what's inside might break."

## Section 2: Pandora's Box

"Open it and fix it." Lin Yi issued the order. Since the mission was to escort cargo, the cargo was their lifeline. If the cargo was destroyed, everyone would be eliminated by the system. "But... the system said we can't open it casually..." The doctor suddenly raised his head, his voice weakly objecting. "This is for maintenance." Lin Yi interrupted him, his gaze sharp. "Mechanic, get to work." The mechanic swallowed, picked up the electric screwdriver, and began removing the maintenance panel on the container's side. As screws fell one by one, more pink liquid flowed out, the sweet cloying scent instantly filling the entire carriage, making everyone feel dizzy and lightheaded.

*Click.*

The last cover plate was removed. The mechanic took a deep breath and forcefully pulled open that heavy metal door. Everyone instinctively held their breath, wanting to see what this "core cargo" that had cost countless lives actually was. Was it a nuclear warhead? Rare minerals? Or some high-tech chip? However, when the scene inside was exposed to the light, the doctor let out a scream, and even the hardened mercenary gasped and instinctively stepped back two paces. Lin Yi's pupils contracted sharply, and the hand gripping his gun trembled slightly from extreme shock.

## Section 3: Brain in a Vat

There were no supplies in the box, no machines either. In that huge glass cylinder filled with pink nutrient solution floated a massive, still faintly pulsating thing. It was a human brain. A complete, gray-white human brain. But this wasn't merely an organ. On this brain's cortex, countless black optical fibers and electrodes were densely inserted, like a terrifying crown of thorns. And below the brain, where the spine should connect, a complex metal base had been implanted, with countless thick blood vessels connected to mechanical pumps. With the pump's humming, those pink liquids were injected into the brain tissue, maintaining its vitality.

Even more chilling, at this brain's frontal lobe position, two human eyeballs remained. Those eyeballs had no eyelids, forcibly held open by metal brackets, staring dead ahead, their gaze unfocused, containing only an eternal, silent scream.

【Item Name: Biological Navigation Computing Unit (Wetware CPU)】
【Model: Mark-IV "Navigator"】
【Description: Uses highly sensitive human brain cortex as the core processor for calculating complex wasteland climate models and logic algorithms to evade mechanical beasts. This is the crystallization of Ark technology—only human intuition can defeat AI logic.】

Lin Yi looked at the system description appearing on his retina, feeling his stomach churn. So this was the so-called "Ark." They weren't escorting supplies—they were escorting one of their own kind. A fellow human who had been stripped of their body, stripped of dignity, transformed into this neither-human-nor-ghost appearance.

## Section 4: The Lie Called Hope

"Urgh—" The doctor finally couldn't hold it in, collapsing on the ground and vomiting violently. He had just been crying over the deaths of those dozens of refugees, but now discovered that what they were desperately protecting was itself the greatest mockery of "human rights." "Is this where we're going?" Su Liang walked to the glass jar, looking at those eyes that wouldn't close in death, her voice turning cold. "Ark One... turns out to be a parts processing factory."

"It's alive." The mechanic pointed tremblingly at the display screen connected to the base. "Look at the brainwaves... it's dreaming. It's been dreaming all along." The waveform graph on the display fluctuated violently, showing this brain was in a state of extreme pain and chaos. Those electrodes inserted deep within weren't just reading data—they were constantly stimulating it, forcing it to perform high-intensity calculations.

Lin Yi reached out his hand and, through the glass, gently touched that cold container. In that instant, his [Danger Sense] suddenly jumped. Not killing intent. But an extremely strong, desperate distress signal. The brain sensed their presence. Those originally clouded eyeballs actually rotated slightly in the nutrient solution, focusing on Lin Yi's face.

*Crackle... crackle...*

The carriage's broadcast suddenly emitted static. It was the brain trying to communicate with their neural interfaces through wireless connection. "Kill... me..." A broken, infant-cry-like electronic synthesized voice echoed through the carriage. "Please... please..."

Lin Yi's hand froze in midair. At this moment, he finally understood what the "greenhouse bastards" meant in that "Ash Outpost" broadcast. Humans of the old era, in order to fight AI, ultimately turned themselves into monsters more cruel than AI. What they were escorting wasn't hope, but a tortured soul heading to that hell called "eternal life."

"Close it." Lin Yi closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he reopened them, the shock in his eyes had been covered by that familiar coldness. "Mechanic, close the door. Fix it."

"You... you're still going to send it to the Ark?" The doctor looked at Lin Yi incredulously. "It's begging for death!"

"Our mission is to deliver it to the destination." Lin Yi turned around, his back to that huge glass jar, his voice cold and hard as iron. "As for whether to destroy it or save it after reaching the destination... that's something only the living have the right to consider. Right now, we can barely survive ourselves."

The mechanic tremblingly closed the panel, and those desperate eyes were once again swallowed by darkness. The carriage returned to deathly silence, only that sweet cloying scent lingering, reminding everyone that they were all accomplices in this sinful transaction.
