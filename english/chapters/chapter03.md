# Chapter 3: The Trap

## Section 1: Strange Silence

Inside the library, dust floated slowly in the light beams coming through the high windows.

Lin Yi sat on the old reading table. His fire axe tapped the table surface over and over, making boring "thud, thud" sounds.

The countdown showed: **12 minutes 45 seconds**.

"This is so boring."

Lin Yi yawned and stared at the main door blocked by bookshelves with nothing to do.

"According to game mechanics, there should be waves of monsters attacking the door now, giving me some experience points. Why is there no sound at all?"

Outside the door was dead silence. No loud banging on the door. No zombie roars. Even the dragging footsteps from before had disappeared.

This kind of quiet didn't feel safe. It felt more like the pressure before a storm.

Lin Yi frowned. His instinct as an experienced gamer told him something was wrong.

"Did the game bug out? Are all the monsters stuck in walls?"

He jumped off the table, grabbed the fire axe, and walked to the door. Through the narrow gap between the bookshelf and door, he squinted and looked outside.

The hallway was empty. In the dim light, he could only see flying dust.

"Really no monsters?"

Lin Yi was about to turn around when suddenly, a very faint metal scraping sound entered his ears.

*Click... creak...*

The sound was soft, like someone carefully turning a key in a lock.

All the hair on Lin Yi's body stood up instantly.

He pressed his face close to the door crack and stared at the brass lock.

He saw the door handle slowly, silently turning.

Outside the door, there was no person with a key. Only a figure in torn school uniform was crouched at the lock. It held a rusty wire in its hands—it looked like it came from a broom. Those rotting fingers were clumsy but very persistent, picking at the lock.

"What... the hell?!"

Lin Yi's eyes went wide. He almost shouted out loud. "This monster can pick locks?!"

This completely went beyond his understanding of "zombie games."

Aren't zombies supposed to just bash their heads against doors with zero intelligence? Why can this zombie use tools? Why does it know how to pick locks?

"Has AI gotten this competitive? Even maxed out lockpicking skills?"

Before Lin Yi could recover from his shock, the lockpicking zombie seemed to sense the eyes watching from behind the door.

It stopped what it was doing and slowly raised its head.

Through the narrow door crack, Lin Yi and the zombie made eye contact.

Those were cloudy eyes with bloodshot whites. But what made Lin Yi's spine go cold was that those eyes didn't have the typical emptiness and confusion.

Instead, the look in those eyes showed a chilling cunning, even a hint of... mockery.

It opened its mouth—missing half its lips—and made an extremely twisted "smile" at Lin Yi through the door crack.

"Something's wrong..."

Lin Yi's heart clenched. A strong sense of danger rushed over him. He instinctively stepped back and gripped his axe tighter.

Just then, a clear shattering sound suddenly exploded behind him.

*CRASH—!!*

## Section 2: Real Pain

Lin Yi spun around.

He saw the high windows above the library—the ones that had iron bars for protection—now had all their glass shattered.

The solid iron bars had somehow been removed. Two black shadows, agile as monkeys, flipped lightly through the window frames and landed silently.

"When did this happen?!"

Lin Yi's pupils shrank violently. He'd been guarding the door the whole time. He hadn't heard any sound of bars being removed.

"They were already here... they're working together! The one at the door was distracting me while these two removed the window!"

This wasn't some rigid game AI at all.

This was a carefully planned hunt. And he was the prey who thought he was safe.

"Damn it!"

Lin Yi was shocked, but he didn't give up fighting. Years of gaming experience made him react quickly.

"Two of them... even though I'm surrounded, if I play it right, I still have a chance."

He roared to give himself courage, raised the fire axe, and charged at the nearest zombie.

"Die!!"

He swung the heavy axe down hard.

Based on previous experience, the zombie would stupidly rush forward and get its head smashed.

But this time, the black shadow made an extremely weird twisting motion just as the axe blade was about to hit. Its upper body bent backward nearly 90 degrees. The axe blade scraped past its nose and hit nothing.

"It dodged?!" Lin Yi missed his strike and lost his balance.

Before he could pull back the axe, the zombie suddenly sprang up. Its dry claws clamped onto Lin Yi's wrist like iron pincers. Huge force came through. Lin Yi felt like his hand bones were about to be crushed.

At the same time, the other zombie launched a surprise attack from the side.

It didn't attack Lin Yi's upper body. Instead, it did a slide tackle—yes, a standard soccer sliding tackle—and kicked hard at the back of Lin Yi's knee.

"Thud!"

Lin Yi's legs went soft and he fell to his knees.

The fire axe flew from his hand and slid several meters away.

"Wait... what kind of move is this?!"

Lin Yi tried to get up in terror, but the two zombies didn't give him a chance. One held down his arms. The other jumped onto his back.

There was no cutscene animation. No red "-10 HP" numbers.

Only a stinking mouth full of blood that bit down hard on Lin Yi's shoulder.

*Splat!*

Teeth pierced skin, tore muscle, scraped against bone.

In that instant, Lin Yi's world collapsed.

"AHHHHHHH—!!!"

A scream so shrill it changed pitch echoed through the entire library.

This wasn't "damage feedback" from a game. This was real, one hundred percent, biological pain.

It felt like a red-hot iron rod was stabbed directly into his nerve center. Like countless dull knives were frantically cutting his flesh.

"It hurts!! It hurts so much!!"

Lin Yi struggled like crazy. Snot and tears poured out instantly. This pain completely exceeded his understanding. It was hell that he'd never experienced in his 19 years of sheltered life.

"Let go! Let go of me!!"

He banged his head on the ground and kicked his feet wildly. But under the two monsters' control, he was like a fish pressed on a cutting board.

A chunk of flesh was torn from his shoulder. Warm blood gushed out, splashing on his face. The bloody smell was no longer "realistic simulation." It was the nauseating smell of rust and death.

"System! Exit! I want to exit the game!!"

Lin Yi frantically called for the system menu in his mind. He made that gesture countless times.

But now, no matter how much he shouted, that familiar blue interface didn't appear.

A "creak" came from the door.

The lockpicking zombie finally opened the door. It walked in slowly, still holding that wire. It walked to Lin Yi, who was rolling on the ground, and looked down at him.

It didn't rush to feed.

It crouched down and used that rusty wire to gently poke into Lin Yi's other good leg.

A little bit, a little bit, slowly twisting.

"AHHHHH—!!!"

Lin Yi's screams had gone hoarse. He looked at the zombie. On that rotting face, he read clear emotions:

Mockery. Cruelty. And enjoyment of "toying with prey."

"This isn't a game..."

On the edge of consciousness collapsing from pain, Lin Yi finally understood.

"This isn't a damn game at all..."

The zombie seemed done playing. It opened its mouth and aimed at Lin Yi's throat.

Darkness fell.
