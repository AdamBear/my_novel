# Chapter 29: Citizen 89757

## Section 1: Reboot

No light. Only the waterfall sound of data streams frantically washing over the retina.

【System self-check... complete.】
【Neural interface connection... stable.】
【Citizen Number: 89757】
【Current Position: F District Lower Pipeline Cleaner】
【Today's Ration: Synthetic Protein Paste (Inferior) x1】
【Directive: Begin work immediately. For the glory of Perfect City.】

Lin Yi opened his eyes.
He didn't remember how he woke up, nor what happened the previous second. His brain felt like it had been filled with cement—heavy, sluggish, with only that line of bright red system directive constantly flashing in the center of his vision, urging him to act.

"Work... glory..."
His lips moved, the sound dry and hoarse, as if he hadn't spoken in a very long time.

He looked down to see himself wearing a one-piece rubber suit stained with black grease, holding a still-humming high-pressure cleaning gun in his hands.
Around him was a narrow, damp, and dim metal corridor. Overhead were densely packed pipes, constantly dripping liquid that reeked of sour decay.
And beside him were a dozen others wearing identical clothing.
They were like a group of programmed ants, mechanically using tools in their hands to clean grime from the walls. No conversation, no eye contact. Each person had a thick black data cable plugged into the back of their head, connected to rails on the ceiling.

Lin Yi instinctively reached for the back of his neck.
There was a cold metal socket, with an identical data cable deeply inserted into his spine, transmitting faint electrical currents with the data flow.

【Warning: Unnecessary movement detected. Please work immediately.】
【Assimilation Rate: 95%】

A yellow warning box popped up on his retina.
That electrical sensation instantly intensified, becoming a needle-like pain, forcing him to lower his hand and grip the cleaning gun again.

"I am... 89757."
Lin Yi's gaze was somewhat confused.
He felt like he'd forgotten something very important. Like who he was? Why was he here?
But under the continuous "feeding" from that data cable, these questions were washed away by a warm, peaceful data stream the moment they surfaced.
*Just work.*
*It's safe here. This is Perfect City. Father is watching over us.*

## Section 2: Life Beyond Bounds

Work continued for an unknown duration.
Here, time seemed to lose meaning, with only the electronic clock on the wall monotonously ticking.

Just as Lin Yi was numbly cleaning a rust stain, a dark shadow suddenly darted out from the shadows deep in the pipes.
*Squeak squeak!*
It was a rat.
A dirty, soaking wet gray rat missing one ear. It scurried frantically across the metal floor, finally stopping at Lin Yi's feet, looking up at him with those black bean-like eyes in a pleading manner, seemingly wanting some food.

Lin Yi's movements stopped.
He looked at that rat. It was a living creature. In this dead world full of metal and grease, this filthy rat actually seemed so... cute.

【Alert: Unregistered organism detected (contamination source).】
【Directive: Eliminate.】
【Execution Method: Crush it.】

His vision instantly turned red.
A red targeting frame locked onto that rat, an arrow pointing to Lin Yi's heavy industrial work boot.
The data cable behind his head began transmitting strong attack signals, attempting to control Lin Yi's leg muscles.

*Step down.*
*It is contamination. It is chaos. It is a tumor that must be excised.*

Lin Yi raised his foot.
The rat seemed to sense danger, trembling but not running—it was too hungry to run.

This was just a rat.
Crush it, complete the mission, get today's protein paste, and... continue living in this warm dream.

But.
Just as his sole was about to fall, a scene suddenly flashed through the depths of Lin Yi's mind.
It was a train racing through wind and snow.
A terrifying room covered in mirrors.
A hospital without light.
And a voice, carrying disdain and arrogance, whispering in his ear:
*"You can't learn the greed and cruelty in human bones."*

Lin Yi's foot froze in midair.
That wasn't just a rat.
That was "the weak."
And Lin Yi had never been the kind of coward who would strike at the weak, much less a puppet manipulated by others.

【Warning: Directive not executed. Assimilation rate rising... 96%... 97%...】
【Second Warning: Eliminate target immediately! Otherwise forced takeover program will activate!】

Intense pain.
The socket behind his head began heating up, the current instantly intensifying tenfold, as if trying to burn out his neural center.
"Urgh..."
Lin Yi clutched his head, painfully collapsing to his knees. But he still didn't step down.
The rat took the opportunity to slip into a nearby crevice and escape.

## Section 3: Fragment of Reality

"I am... Lin Yi."
Sweat slid down his cheeks, dripping onto the greasy floor. Lin Yi gritted his teeth, the confusion in his eyes being replaced by a familiar, beast-like ferocity.
"I'm not some damn 89757!"
"I'm Sample No. 17! I'm the Lin Yi who's going to drag you Observers down from your altar!"

【Critical Error: Sample consciousness rebound.】
【Initiating formatting program...】

The red warning on his retina turned black.
Lin Yi felt his consciousness being extracted by a massive force, that warm data stream becoming a cold tsunami, trying to drown his last vestiges of personality.

"Want to brainwash me?"
Lin Yi let out a savage laugh.
His hand trembled as it reached into the inner pocket of his coveralls.
Even when the system reset his identity and stripped his equipment, one thing had always clung tightly to his chest. Because it wasn't system data—it was "reality" he'd crashed off Ark's gate.

He found it.
It was a cold, sharp, black metal fragment with serrated edges—【Fragment of Reality】(Ark Pass Fragment).

【Item: Fragment of Reality】
【Effect: Physically sever virtual connection.】

Lin Yi gripped the fragment tightly, its sharp edge cutting his palm, blood flowing.
But he didn't hesitate at all.
He reversed his grip and viciously stabbed the fragment toward the back of his neck.

## Section 4: Virus Online

"Ahhhhh—!!!"
This wasn't the system's scream—it was Lin Yi's own.
The fragment didn't insert like a key into a lock, but brutally cut through skin and wedged into the metal socket's gap.
He activated [Pain Blocking].
Though pain was blocked, he could clearly feel the vibration of metal scraping on bone.

"Break... for me!!!"
Lin Yi roared, his wrist suddenly exerting force, flicking upward.

*Riiip—!!!*
Accompanied by a teeth-grinding metal snapping sound and dazzling electrical sparks, that black data cable connected to his spine was forcibly pried off!

*Thud.*
Lin Yi crashed heavily to the ground.
The severed data cable writhed on the floor like a dying snake, frantically convulsing and spraying blue arcs.

【Connection lost.】
【Citizen 89757... offline.】
【Assimilation rate... cleared.】

The red directive box in his vision flickered twice, completely shattered, dissolving into countless garbled characters.
That oppressive, heavy feeling that made one want to kneel in submission finally disappeared.

Lin Yi gasped heavily, crawling up from the ground.
Though still disheveled, though covered in blood, the light in his eyes was brighter than ever before.

The "coworkers" around him continued working mechanically, completely oblivious to what had just happened. They'd been completely assimilated, becoming parts of this machine.

Lin Yi glanced at the blood-stained fragment in his hand, then at the intricate pipe network overhead.
This was the bottom. The garbage heap.
And far above, overhead, was that so-called "Perfect City," that "Father" who thought himself God.

"System."
Lin Yi wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, revealing a savage smile to the void.
"Antivirus software is offline."
"Now, the virus is online."

He hefted that high-pressure cleaning gun (now his only melee weapon) and turned toward the corridor exit.
He was going to find Su Liang.
Then burn this tower to ash, from bottom to top.
