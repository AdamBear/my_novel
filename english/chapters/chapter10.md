# **Chapter 10: Auditory Radar**

## **Section 1: The Blind Man's Guide Dog**

The stairwell leading to basement level 2 was like a beast's esophagus—narrow, damp, echoing with unsettling wind sounds.

Lin Yi followed three steps behind Su Liang.

This was a very delicate distance—close enough to hear her instructions clearly, yet far enough to have half a second to react if she suddenly attacked.

"Stop."

Su Liang's voice was light, like a ghost's sigh in the darkness.

Lin Yi immediately froze like someone had pressed pause, even deliberately slowing his breathing, exhaling the air from his lungs in three slow breaths.

"Three o'clock direction, under the stair railing." Su Liang's tone was completely flat. "There's one hanging there. Heartbeat is very slow, should be in dormant state."

Lin Yi couldn't see. In his perception, there was only a mass of pitch-black nothingness.

But he chose to trust.

Because in the past ten minutes, this woman had proven the value of those ears. She'd avoided three monster patrol routes and bypassed a ventilation opening full of spore traps.

She was like a precision biological radar.

"Go around it. Stick to the left wall, lighten your footsteps." Su Liang issued the command.

Lin Yi did as told. His bare feet stepped on the dust-covered edge of the steps, making almost no sound.

When he passed the location Su Liang mentioned, he felt an extremely cold chill hit his face. Then came an extremely faint sound like amniotic fluid stirring—*gurgle*.

That thing was sleeping less than half a meter away from him.

If he made even a slight noise, or if that woman deliberately coughed loudly...

Lin Yi's back muscles instantly tensed, cold sweat sliding down his spine.

He was putting his life in someone else's hands. This feeling made him extremely uncomfortable. In this dark forest, trust was a luxury more scarce than light.

"Safe now."

After passing that dangerous section, Su Liang's voice rang out again. "Continue down."

"Your talent is strong." Lin Yi broke the silence in a low voice. This wasn't just flattery, but also a probe. "How far can you hear?"

"It depends on environmental noise."

Su Liang didn't turn around. She felt her way forward along the wall in the darkness while answering coldly, "In this silent hospital, I can hear heartbeats through two walls. I can even tell the strength of that scarface's last heartbeat before death—it was ventricular fibrillation caused by extreme fear."

She was warning me.

Lin Yi understood her subtext: Don't try any tricks, your heartbeat will betray you.

"If you're so strong, why do you still need me?" Lin Yi asked back.

Su Liang stopped.

In the darkness, Lin Yi felt her turn around to face him.

"Because radar can only scan, not kill." Su Liang's voice carried an extremely rational coldness. "Just now in the pharmacy, your method of using light to kill was dirty, but also very effective. This kind of 'killing with a borrowed knife' brain is what I lack."

"I'm the ears, you're the brain. This is a resource exchange for survival."

"Makes sense." Lin Yi nodded, though the other person couldn't see. "But how do I know that when you don't need a brain anymore, you won't dispose of me like that scarface?"

"You don't know."

Su Liang laughed lightly, that laugh sounding particularly eerie in the darkness. "So, you'd better pray that I still need you before we find the generator."

## **Section 2: The Price of High Frequency**

The two finally reached basement level 2.

The air here was even more turbid than above, filled with a strong smell like rotting mushrooms fermenting. The walls were covered with a thick layer of slippery bacterial mat that made a faint *sizzle* sound when stepped on.

"Shh."

Su Liang suddenly raised her hand, making a stop gesture.

Her body leaned slightly forward, ear toward the depths of the corridor, brow furrowed.

"What's wrong?" Lin Yi asked in a breath.

"Up ahead... it's noisy." Su Liang's expression showed some pain. "Lots of noise. Is that a fan? Or some kind of large machinery running..."

Just then.

*SCREECH—!!!*

A sharp electrical screech suddenly exploded from the speaker in the depths of the corridor. It was that characteristic high-frequency noise of old broadcast systems being interfered with.

Though the sound wasn't loud, even somewhat distorted, to Lin Yi it was just harsh.

However, Su Liang's reaction was alarmingly intense.

"Ah!!"

She suddenly covered her ears, her whole body curling up like a shrimp, painfully collapsing to her knees.

"Turn it off... quickly turn it off!!"

Her voice was trembling, even carrying a crying tone. That wasn't fake—Lin Yi could hear her heartbeat instantly spike from the severe pain, so fast it seemed about to explode from her chest.

Lin Yi was stunned for a moment, then his eyes flashed.

Enhanced hearing.

Everything has a price.

Since her hearing had been enhanced by the system to the point of hearing heartbeats, her eardrums' tolerance for high-decibel noise must be far lower than normal people.

It was like turning a microphone's sensitivity to maximum—any slight feedback would be amplified into deafening roar.

For Su Liang, this electrical sound was no different from detonating a flashbang next to her ear.

"Opportunity."

A thought flashed through Lin Yi's mind.

At this moment, Su Liang had completely lost her defensive capability. If he had a brick in his hand, or even just pushed her...

But he didn't move.

Because from the darkness ahead came that familiar *click* sound.

That electrical sound hadn't just hurt Su Liang—it had also alerted nearby monsters.

"Get up!"

Lin Yi grabbed Su Liang's arm and forcibly pulled her up from the ground. "Monsters are coming! Left or right?!"

Su Liang was covered in cold sweat. She shook her head painfully, the tinnitus temporarily robbing her of her "radar" function.

"I... I can't hear clearly... all noise..."

"Then we gamble!"

Lin Yi didn't waste more words. Based on the vague map memory he'd glimpsed earlier (though very blurry), he pulled Su Liang stumbling into a laundry room on the right.

## **Section 3: One-Time Probe**

The two had just rushed into the room when Lin Yi slammed the heavy iron door shut with his backhand.

*BANG!*

Almost the same second the door closed, a heavy body crashed into the door panel.

*THUD!!*

The iron door shook violently, the lock letting out an overburdened groan.

"Huff... huff..."

Lin Yi leaned against the door panel, holding it firmly, gasping for breath.

Outside the door came the monster's angry scratching sounds, those sharp nails scraping metal making teeth ache.

Su Liang slumped in the corner, hands still covering her ears, face pale as paper.

A full five minutes passed.

The scratching sounds outside finally stopped. That monster seemed to lose patience and wandered elsewhere.

Only the two people's rapid breathing remained in the room.

"Feeling better?" Lin Yi asked coldly.

Su Liang slowly lowered her hands. She raised her head, those originally cool eyes now bloodshot. She looked deeply at Lin Yi.

"Just now... why didn't you attack?"

"What?"

"When that noise sounded, I had three seconds of complete defenselessness." Su Liang's voice returned to calm, but added a hint of wariness. "That was the best chance to kill me. Kill me, you could take my point items and eliminate a competitor."

Lin Yi straightened his collar in the darkness, tone flat:

"First, I don't know where the generator is. Even if I killed you, I'd have a hard time finding the generator room while blind."

"Second, that monster came too fast. If I killed you, no one would help me identify positions by sound, and I'd die too."

"So, don't flatter yourself."

Lin Yi turned his head, staring at Su Liang's blurry outline, the corner of his mouth curving into a cruel arc.

"I saved you because you're still useful. Just like you would abandon me for survival, when your value is exhausted, or when your existence threatens me..."

"I'll push you out to feed that monster without hesitation."

Su Liang fell silent.

A moment later, she let out a light laugh in the darkness.

"Very good."

She supported herself against the wall to stand up. "Lin Yi, you really are a natural bastard. In this hellhole, cooperating with a bastard is more reassuring."

"Likewise."

Lin Yi touched the half piece of glass shard in his pocket.

He hadn't told the truth.

Besides the reasons above, there was another more important reason he didn't attack:

He'd found her "fatal weakness."

That was enough.

An ally with a weakness was more valuable than a dead ally.

As long as he created enough noise, this powerful "hearing ability user" would instantly become a lamb for slaughter. This trump card—he'd save it for the final moment of clearing the instance.

"Let's go." Su Liang seemed to have recovered her hearing. She pointed to another door in the laundry room. "Through here is the surgical area. That big guy (Boss) is over there."

"Its breathing sound... is simply like a bellows."
