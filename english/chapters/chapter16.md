# Chapter 16: The Vanishing Step

## Section 1: The 13th Step

Night fell faster than expected.

The apartment's broadcast system had just announced "8 PM, wishing all residents sweet dreams," when the sky outside the window went dark instantly, switching from dusk to pitch black as if someone had pulled a circuit breaker.

Lin Yi stood in the living room, looking at the yellowed rules paper in his hand.

[Rule 2: After 8:00 PM, please draw the curtains...]

"Draw the curtains." Lin Yi issued the order in a low voice.

Su Liang moved efficiently, pulling the heavy blackout curtains tightly closed, even using clips to seal the middle gap, leaving no trace of light.

"What's the arrangement for tonight?" Su Liang sat on the sofa, toying with the newly exchanged tactical knife. Although her hearing had recovered, in this building, she relied more on this blade.

"Wait."

Lin Yi sat in the darkness, eyes slightly closed. "That tattooed man (Sample 33) violated the 'no quarreling' rule during the day. If the rules are real, property management will make their move tonight."

Just then, urgent and heavy footsteps came from the hallway.

*Thud, thud, thud!*

That was the sound of boots stomping on wooden stairs, accompanied by heavy panting and suppressed cursing.

"It's that tattooed man." Su Liang's ears twitched. "He's running. Heart rate is very fast, 140 beats per minute. He's... going downstairs?"

Lin Yi's eyes snapped open.

[Rule 5: The hallway has 12 steps. If you count a 13th step...]

"He's running to the first floor." Lin Yi lowered his voice. "Listen carefully to his footsteps. From this floor to the next, how many steps are there?"

Su Liang closed her eyes, lightly tapping her fingers on her knee, counting along with the footsteps in the hallway.

"1, 2, 3..."

The tattooed man in the hallway seemed to have encountered something terrifying. He was in a mad dash, his footsteps chaotic and heavy.

"...10, 11, 12."

Su Liang's brows suddenly furrowed.

Because those footsteps didn't stop at the landing, but continued downward.

"13."

A crisp sound of a foot hitting a wooden board rang out.

Immediately after.

All sounds stopped abruptly.

No screams, no sound of falling, even that rapid breathing was cut off in an instant out of thin air. Like a cassette tape that was playing, suddenly someone pressed the stop button and pulled out the magnetic strip.

Deathly silence enveloped the entire apartment building.

"He's gone." Su Liang opened her eyes, her face somewhat pale in the darkness. "The instant he landed on the 13th step, his heartbeat... disappeared."

Lin Yi felt a chill run up his spine.

"It's not death."

Lin Yi analyzed calmly. "When a person dies, the heart stops, but the body falling would make a sound. This kind of instant silence means he was 'taken away.' Taken to a place that doesn't belong to this physical space."

## Section 2: The Face at the Window

Before the two could digest this eerie scene, the living room window suddenly made a soft sound.

*Pat.*

Like something wet pressed against the glass.

Lin Yi and Su Liang simultaneously turned to look at the curtain.

The heavy curtain blocked their view, but they could clearly hear that sound moving.

*Squelch... squelch...*

That was the sound of skin rubbing against glass.

[Rule 2: ...If you see a face pressed against the glass outside the window, please ignore it...]

Lin Yi immediately made a "silence" gesture to Su Liang, and the two froze like statues, even reducing their breathing to the lowest frequency.

This was the 4th floor.

There was no balcony or foothold outside the window.

Whatever was wiping the glass was either floating in mid-air, or... was extremely long, extending from the ground all the way to the 4th floor.

*Knock, knock, knock.*

That thing started knocking on the window. The rhythm was slow, very polite.

"I want to come in..."

A voice as thin as gossamer penetrated through the glass and curtain. That voice sounded very familiar, even a bit like... Auntie Wang from this morning?

"I have freshly baked cookies... still warm... let me in to give you a taste..."

The voice was full of temptation, sickeningly sweet.

Lin Yi stared intently at the curtain.

In that instant, he seemed to see a faint red light seeping through the gap in the curtain. That wasn't lamplight, but more like the phosphorescence emitted by some creature's bloodshot eyeball.

[Danger Sense] was still playing dead.

In Lin Yi's mind, whatever was knocking on the window had no killing intent whatsoever. It seemed to genuinely just want to come in and deliver cookies.

"Don't listen, don't think, don't respond." Lin Yi chanted silently in his mind.

In this type of rules horror scenario, the most taboo thing was creating "logical interaction." Once you started thinking "how did it get up there" or "should I refuse," you'd already established a connection with it.

The knocking continued for a full ten minutes.

Then, that voice suddenly changed.

No longer Auntie Wang's sweet voice, it became a shrill male voice—it was the tattooed man who had just disappeared!

"Save me... Lin Yi! I know you're in there! Save me!!"

"They're eating my brain!! Aaaah—"

Su Liang's body trembled violently. She instinctively wanted to cover her ears, but was held down by Lin Yi.

"Fake." Lin Yi mouthed the words. "Mimicry."

If you opened the window, outside wouldn't be the tattooed man, but that thing mimicking his screams.

Another ten minutes passed.

The sound outside the window finally disappeared. That wet rubbing sound slid down the wall, seemingly going to harass the residents downstairs.

## Section 3: The Perfect Returner

That night, the two took turns keeping watch, neither daring to sleep deeply.

Until the next morning, when the broadcast once again played cheerful bird chirps and morning news, that oppressive sense of terror finally dissipated slightly.

Sunlight filled the living room again, everything seeming to return to "perfection."

"Let's go outside and look."

Lin Yi washed his face (deliberately avoiding the mirror) and led Su Liang out the door.

As soon as they reached the stairwell, they froze.

That tattooed man (Sample 33) was standing in the courtyard garden downstairs.

He wasn't dead.

Not only wasn't he dead, all his hostility had disappeared. That leather jacket that was originally left open revealing chest hair and tattoos was now buttoned up neatly, even the collar button fastened.

He was holding a broom, helping the elderly man he'd shoved yesterday sweep the ground.

"Good morning, Grandpa Wang."

The tattooed man's voice was gentle, polite, even carrying a trace of respect. "I was ignorant yesterday and caused you trouble. I'm working hard to learn how to be a civilized resident."

"Knowing your mistakes and correcting them makes you a good child." Grandpa Wang patted his shoulder with a smile.

This scene was so harmonious it was like a propaganda poster.

Lin Yi stood by the fourth-floor railing, feeling all the blood in his body go cold.

"Su Liang." Lin Yi stared fixedly at the tattooed man's back. "Listen."

Su Liang closed her eyes and listened intently. After a few seconds, she opened her eyes, terror filling them.

"His heartbeat..."

Su Liang's voice trembled slightly. "Last night when he was running, his heartbeat was 140 beats of chaotic noise."

"But now..."

"60 beats per minute. Absolutely uniform. Every beat with exactly the same force."

"That's... a metronome."

Lin Yi took a deep breath, his palm gripping the rust-stained railing tightly.

The real Sample 33, that violent, rude but vibrant life, had disappeared on the 13th step last night.

What now stood there was wearing his skin, possessed his memories, but whose core had been completely replaced—

A [False Person].

And most terrifying was that aside from Lin Yi and Su Liang, the other players were gathered around the tattooed man, asking him what happened last night. The tattooed man answered fluently, even sharing so-called "hidden intelligence."

He was infiltrating.

He was turning the other players, one by one, into that.

"Let's go."

Lin Yi turned and went back inside. "We've got big trouble."
