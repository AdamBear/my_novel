# **Prologue: Sample 17**

**[System Starting...]**

**[Connecting to Neural Interface... Connection Stable]**

**[Observation Target: Sample 17 (Lin Yi)]**

**[Gene Marker: [Nirvana] (Detection Progress 0.00%)]**

**[Current Environment: One-Star Instance - Abandoned School]**

Darkness.

Absolute, deathly darkness.

In this void where nothing exists, only countless streams of glowing blue data flow silently, weaving together. They're like blood vessels, converging toward a massive holographic screen in the center. The screen hasn't fully lit up yet—only static snow flickers wildly, accompanied by the crackling sound of electrical current passing through neural synapses.

"System self-check complete."

"Neural connection stability: 98.7%."

"Consciousness upload complete."

A flat, mechanical voice echoes through the void. It has no source, as if it's directly vibrating the rules of this space itself.

"Retrieving observation target file..."

The data streams in the center of the screen suddenly freeze, then explode, transforming into a detailed profile:

**Code Name:** Sample 17
**Name:** Lin Yi
**Age:** 19
**Occupation:** College Freshman / Veteran Horror Game Speedrunner
**Gene Marker:** [Nirvana]

"Confirming environment parameters." The mechanical voice continues its report, like a judge executing a death sentence. "Pain synchronization rate set to 100% (absolute lock). Smell, touch, and taste simulation set to real-world level. Death mechanism... confirmed for actual execution."

At this moment, a barely noticeable ripple passes through the void. It's another voice—also processed, but carrying a hint of intelligent cruelty and amusement: "100% pain? Isn't that too harsh for a kid raised in a greenhouse? Normal VR games cap pain at 5% or less."

"It's necessary." The mechanical voice coldly rejects the objection. "Fear is humanity's only catalyst for evolution, and pain is the carrier of fear. If he treats this as just a game, he'll never awaken the [Nirvana] gene. We need warriors, not players."

"Fine." The more human voice chuckles lightly. "Then let's see how long this self-proclaimed 'horror game expert' can last in this entry-level hell called 'Abandoned School.'"

The static on the screen suddenly vanishes, replaced by an image of terrifying clarity.

It's a dilapidated classroom. A young man lies on the dusty concrete floor, his eyelids trembling slightly, about to wake up.

"Test beginning. Good luck, Sample 17."
