# Chapter 24: Zero-Sum Game

## Section 1: Entropy Increase in Thermodynamics

The flames from the incendiary grenade gradually died out. The burnt protein smell in the air didn't dissipate, but instead congealed in every corner of the carriage due to the low temperature, like a layer of unwashable grease. The veteran teammate who had been burned to charcoal was now just a pool of black residue, mixed with the wreckage of mechanical scorpions, no longer distinguishable between human and machine. This was what the system called elimination—clean, thorough, not even ashes to sweep. The mechanic tremblingly welded the last steel plate on the roof. With a hiss of steam, the carriage's air pressure rebalanced, and the frantically flashing temperature alarm finally turned to stable yellow light. The pointer on the thermometer slowly began rising from minus twenty degrees. They survived. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief internally. The doctor (Sample No. 105) who had been hiding behind the container finally dared to peek out. Looking at the pool of black ash on the ground, his face turned deathly pale. He wanted to vomit but didn't dare, only managing two dry heaves. "Stop looking." The surviving mercenary roughly pushed the doctor aside and sat heavily on the ground, gasping for breath. "This hellhole... really isn't fit for humans."

However, this relief from escaping death lasted less than two minutes. *Beep... beep... beep...* Just as the carriage temperature had barely risen to zero degrees, the pressure gauge on the control panel suddenly emitted a piercing low hum. The red pointer that should have been rising began plummeting like a cliff. "What's happening?!" The mercenary jumped up. "Why did the heating stop?!" The mechanic scrambled to the pressure valve, his grease-covered hands frantically slapping several instrument panels, his expression instantly becoming worse than when facing the mechanical wolf. "No... it didn't stop." The mechanic's voice carried a sob, desperately pointing at the row of pipes connecting to the rear carriage. "It's flowing backward! The rear carriage... the rear carriage has lost pressure! That side is now a giant ice cave, sucking all our heat away!"

"Someone cut off the main heating valve back there and blew open the rear carriage's skin." Su Liang, who had been silent, suddenly spoke. She closed her eyes, fingers pressed against the cold carriage wall, as if reading information from afar through the steel's vibrations. "I heard it... about two carriages away, there's laughter. Electronically distorted laughter. It's the hostile faction." This was PvP. The Raiders didn't choose to assault the heavily armed Carriage Nine head-on, but instead chose a more insidious method that followed physical laws—creating a thermodynamic trap. They turned the rear carriage into a black hole that extracted heat from Carriage Nine.

## Section 2: The Trolley Problem

"What happens if we don't cut the connection?" Lin Yi walked to the control panel, looking at the rapidly dropping values, his voice terrifyingly calm. The mechanic swallowed, tremblingly holding up two fingers: "Twenty minutes. At most twenty minutes, Carriage Nine's heat will be drained, the core cargo will freeze, and we... we'll freeze to death too." "Then cut it." Lin Yi's answer came without hesitation, as simple as deciding what to have for dinner. "Jettison the rear carriages." "No!" A scream interrupted Lin Yi. It was the doctor. Like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, he lunged at the control panel, desperately protecting the red lever marked [Emergency Decoupling]. "You can't do this!" The doctor's eyes were frighteningly red, whether from fear or anger. "Behind us is the refugee carriage! The system background said it's for evacuating survivors from this area... even if they're NPCs, that's still dozens of lives! And... and I heard it too, there was banging on the connection door, people calling for help! Children crying!"

Lin Yi looked at him expressionlessly. Indeed, through the thick airtight door at the carriage connection, one could faintly hear muffled impacts and weak cries from the other side. Those people trapped in the depressurized rear carriage—whether NPCs or low-level players who hadn't awakened—were desperately pounding on the only door to survival. "Move aside." Lin Yi raised his hand, the dark gun muzzle pressed directly against the doctor's forehead. The cold metal touch made the doctor's whole body tremble, but he surprisingly didn't back down. "I won't!" The doctor shouted with his eyes closed, his body shaking, but his hands still gripping the lever tightly. "We're the Guard! Our mission is to protect humans, not murder! If we open the door and let them in..." "Open the door, and heat will convect." Lin Yi coldly interrupted him, his tone carrying an unquestionable authority—the arrogance of a science student stating axioms. "Carriage Nine's volume and heat reserves are only enough to maintain the current six people and the core cargo. If we open the door, letting in cold air from that side, or letting those people in to share the heat, there's only one result: everyone freezes to death together."

"It's called the second law of thermodynamics, doctor. Entropy increase is irreversible." Lin Yi's finger rested on the trigger, applying slight pressure. "Here, heat is life. Compassion? That's a luxury only the dead can afford."

## Section 3: Tyranny of the Majority

The doctor was still hesitating, his moral compass teetering before the logic of life and death. He looked at the others, trying to find supporters. "Do you... do you all agree? That's dozens of lives!" The mechanic shrank in the corner, hugging his wrench, avoiding the doctor's gaze. He was a coward who just wanted to live. The mercenary spat, stood up from the ground, walked behind the doctor, grabbed his collar, and lifted him aside like a chicken. "Stop your fucking nonsense, bookworm." The mercenary's voice was crude and direct. "I don't want to become an ice sculpture. The captain's right—better them than us." Su Liang stood behind Lin Yi the whole time, playing with her dagger, not even glancing at the doctor. Her stance was clear: Lin Yi was her creditor, and the creditor's decision was her decision.

In this sealed steel box, democracy failed. Or rather, this was the truest democracy—the survival will of the majority crushed the moral persistence of the minority. "You... you're all devils..." The doctor collapsed on the ground, tears streaming down. He looked at Lin Yi, his eyes filled with despair and accusation. "You'll face retribution." "Maybe." Lin Yi holstered his gun, completely unmoved by the curse. He stepped forward and gripped the cold red lever.

## Section 4: Disconnection

*Click.* There was no earth-shattering boom. Just the soft sigh of hydraulic locks releasing. Then the carriage shook violently, and the speed seemed to lighten instantly. Lin Yi looked out through the rear observation window. The originally connected Carriage Ten was rapidly receding. The connection lines snapped, spraying white steam. In the darkness gradually swallowed by the blizzard, Carriage Ten's lights flickered twice and went completely dark. Vaguely, Lin Yi seemed to see countless pale faces pressed against the airtight door's glass, and those desperate handprints. A few seconds later, that carriage completely disappeared into the eternal night's blizzard, becoming another mobile ice coffin on the wasteland.

Carriage Nine's temperature began rising. The alarm was lifted. Lin Yi turned around, his back to the observation window, his face expressionless. He glanced at the doctor collapsed on the ground, then at the silent crowd. "Stop spacing out." Lin Yi's voice remained calm, as if he hadn't just personally buried dozens of lives. "Check equipment, take turns on watch. The Raiders cut off our tail, next they'll attack our head." Su Liang looked at Lin Yi's back, her eyes flickering slightly. She suddenly remembered what Lin Yi had said to the fake person at the transit station: "You can't learn the greed and cruelty in human bones." At this moment, she truly understood the meaning of those words. To survive, this man could sever everything. Including humanity.
