# Chapter 18: Turing Test

## Section 1: Enthusiastic Mob

"Open the door! Little Lin! It's Auntie Wang!"

"We heard glass breaking! Are you hurt? Let us in to check!"

"I have hemostatic medicine... and freshly baked cookies..."

The security door of Room 404 was being pounded thunderously. The voices outside were no longer individual inquiries, but had become a chorus of dozens of people. Those voices—enthusiastic, concerned, overflowing with "warm" neighborliness—at this moment sounded like starving ghosts from hell scratching at the door.

That excessively uniform knocking rhythm—*thud, thud, thud*—dozens of hands falling and rising simultaneously, even the frequency completely identical—made one's scalp tingle.

"Can't hold it."

Su Liang braced herself against the sofa being used as a barricade, face pale. "This door won't last half a minute. That Auntie Wang... her strength is like a bear's."

Lin Yi clutched his bleeding right arm and looked out the window.

Fourth floor. Jumping down would result in death or severe injury.

"The rooftop."

Lin Yi made a quick decision. "The rules don't say we can't go to the rooftop. Plus that terrain is open, suitable for maneuvering."

"Let's go!"

The two abandoned their defense and turned to rush toward the maintenance ladder leading to the roof.

The instant they climbed the ladder, the security door collapsed with a crash.

By the light from the hallway, Lin Yi glanced back.

There were no ferocious monsters.

The doorway was crowded with neighbors. Auntie Wang, Grandpa Li, and that tattooed man who had become a False Person. They all wore that standard, even somewhat compassionate smile, holding brooms, rolling pins, even whetstones.

"Why are you running..."

Auntie Wang looked up at Lin Yi climbing the ladder, her eyeballs trembling slightly in their sockets. "We just want to... help you repair yourselves."

## Section 2: Separated in the Fog

The rooftop was enveloped in thick white fog.

This fog appeared without warning, carrying a faint burnt smell like printer toner. Visibility was less than five meters.

"Hold on to me!"

Lin Yi reached behind him.

But the instant his fingers touched, he grasped nothing.

Su Liang, who had been right behind him, was gone.

"Su Liang?!" Lin Yi growled.

No one responded. Only white fog flowing, and the occasional sound of uniform footsteps in the distance.

They'd been scattered.

Or this damned fog was blocking perception.

Lin Yi immediately pressed his back against the ventilation duct wall, forcing himself to calm down. His right arm's wound still throbbed dully, blood soaking through his sleeve.

This pain was currently the only reality.

"[Danger Sense] is ineffective, meaning the enemy has no killing intent."

"They want to 'assimilate' me."

Lin Yi narrowed his eyes, gripping the bloody mirror fragment in his hand (which was now his only weapon).

Since he couldn't rely on perception, he could only rely on his brain.

If the monsters possessed his memories, possessed his appearance, even possessed human logic... then what was the only standard for distinguishing true from false?

Flaws.

The uniquely human selfishness, greed, and malice that couldn't be simulated by algorithms.

## Section 3: Perfect Rescue

"Lin Yi?"

A familiar voice suddenly came from the fog ahead and to the side.

Somewhat urgent, somewhat worried.

Lin Yi didn't immediately respond, but silently shrank further into the shadows.

A figure walked out of the fog.

It was Su Liang.

She looked somewhat disheveled, hair messy, clothes stained with dust. Still tightly gripping that tactical knife.

The instant she saw Lin Yi, she visibly relaxed and quickly walked over.

"You're here! You scared me to death."

Su Liang walked up to Lin Yi, her gaze immediately falling on his bleeding right arm. Her eyes showed a trace of undisguised heartache and self-blame.

"Your hand is still bleeding... all because of saving me."

Su Liang quickly put away the knife and pulled out a roll of clean bandage from her pocket. "Quick, let me look at the wound. If we don't stop the bleeding, it'll get infected."

Her movements were gentle, her tone sincere.

In that instant, Lin Yi even felt a moment of wavering. Wasn't this the teammate who'd been through life and death with him?

But.

Lin Yi didn't extend his hand.

He just coldly looked at this woman before him preparing to bandage him.

"What's wrong?" Su Liang looked up, somewhat puzzled. "Hurry up, those neighbors will be up here soon."

"Su Liang."

Lin Yi suddenly spoke, his voice flat, emotionless. "How much money do I owe you?"

"What?" Su Liang froze, seeming not to react.

"I signed a contract with you at the transit station." Lin Yi stared into her eyes. "How many points do I owe you?"

Su Liang's expression stiffened for an instant, but then returned to natural. She sighed, smiling somewhat helplessly:

"At a time like this, you're thinking about that? We're teammates, partners. In this hellhole, life is more important than money. That debt... let's just write it off, as long as we can get out alive."

What a touching answer.

What an answer full of humanistic brilliance, conforming to universal values.

If placed in any hot-blooded anime, this would be standard bonding dialogue.

But Lin Yi smiled.

Smiled extremely cruelly.

## Section 4: Humanity's Turing Test

*Squelch!*

Without any warning.

The mirror fragment in Lin Yi's hand viciously stabbed into the neck of this "Su Liang" before him.

Fast, accurate, ruthless. Straight for the carotid artery.

"You..."

"Su Liang" widened her eyes, looking at Lin Yi in disbelief. She seemed unable to understand why, despite performing so kindly, so selflessly, she received a fatal blow in return.

"Wrong answer."

Lin Yi pulled out the fragment, bringing out a stream of black, motor oil-like viscous liquid.

"The real Su Liang is an extremely selfish miser."

Lin Yi looked coldly at this False Person before him, now convulsing and deforming, his tone carrying a trace of mockery. "If you were really her, you'd say: 'Cut the crap, 450 points with interest, short me a penny and I'll cripple your other hand too.'"

"You monsters can learn human expressions, can learn human language."

"But you'll never learn the greed and harshness in humanity's bones."

That "Su Liang" clutched her neck, the expression on her face beginning to collapse. That concern and gentleness disappeared, replaced by a featureless, mirror-smooth face.

It emitted an electronic-sounding wail, its body turning into a puddle of black water, seeping into cracks in the ground.

[Killed False Person (Larva)] [Obtained Points: 100]

Lin Yi shook off the black blood on his hand, his expression even grimmer.

This was just a larva. A low-level False Person that had just learned to mimic superficially.

What if he encountered a higher-level one?

What if he encountered that... "Mother" that could even mimic greed and harshness?

Just then.

Footsteps came from the fog behind him again.

Another figure walked out.

The exact same face, the exact same tactical knife.

"Lin Yi?"

This newly appeared Su Liang looked at the puddle of black water on the ground, then at Lin Yi covered in blood, frowning, her eyes full of disgust and vigilance.

"What are you doing? Making such a mess."

She said coldly, simultaneously subconsciously stepping two paces away from Lin Yi. "Don't expect me to wash your clothes. Also, when we got separated earlier, did you step on my foot?"

Lin Yi looked at her.

That tone, that demeanor, that annoying sense of distance.

Very similar.

Really similar.

But Lin Yi's hand holding the fragment didn't loosen.

Because in this maze where truth and falsehood were indistinguishable, trust was a luxury more expensive than death.

"Stand there, don't move."

Lin Yi raised the fragment stained with black blood, pointing it at the newly appeared Su Liang. "Now, it's your turn to take the test."
