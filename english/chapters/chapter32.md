# Chapter 32: Arbiter

## Section 1: Gatekeeper

The entrance to B District's administrative layer was a black alloy gate ten meters high, carved with a massive double helix gene pattern, symbolizing Perfect City's worship of "evolution."

There were no neon lights here, no noisy advertisements, only suffocating solemnity and deathly silence.

"It's right ahead."

Su Liang pressed against the wall corner, her face pale. Even from dozens of meters away, her acute auditory nerves were still painfully shaken by the electromagnetic noise from that behemoth ahead. "That sound... like a turbine engine running at high speed."

Lin Yi loaded a new magazine. The P-19 Enforcer pistol's body was already slightly warm.

"Hide well."

Lin Yi said in a low voice, then strode out from the shadows.

*BOOM—!*

The moment he stepped into the warning zone, a red laser scanning net descended from above. Then, accompanied by the roar of hydraulic systems, a black steel giant crashed heavily to the ground from a dark slot above the gate.

Dust rose.

That wasn't human, not even an ordinary cyborg.

It stood nearly three meters tall, covered entirely in black nanocomposite armor, its limbs modified into streamlined killing weapons. At its head position was only a single massive eye glowing crimson red, coldly observing Lin Yi.

【Elite Unit: Arbiter】
【Model: T-8000 Riot Suppression Type】
【Directive: Eliminate all imperfect individuals.】

"Malfunction detected. Execute deletion."

Without any preamble, the Arbiter's back thrusters sprayed blue flames, its massive body instantly transforming into a black lightning bolt, charging at Lin Yi.

*Bang bang bang!*

Lin Yi raised his hand and fired three shots.

The electromagnetically accelerated armor-piercing rounds precisely hit the Arbiter's chest, but only sparked a few powerless sparks on the thick armor, not even leaving a scratch.

"Damn, just scratching it."

Lin Yi rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the Arbiter's heavy punch.

*BOOM!*

The ground where he'd just stood was directly smashed into a two-meter diameter crater, debris flying and painfully hitting Lin Yi's face.

## Section 2: Absolute Computing Power

This wasn't a battle—this was one-sided crushing.

The Arbiter's speed, strength, and defense all far exceeded human limits. More terrifying was its combat logic—it was AI, possessing absolute computing power.

Lin Yi tried using cover for guerrilla tactics, but the Arbiter could always predict his routes.

When he ran left, the Arbiter's high-frequency vibration sword had already blocked the left space; when he tried sliding from below, its leg thrusters were already prepared to trample.

"It's useless."

Su Liang's voice urgently sounded in the communication channel. "Lin Yi, don't compete with it on positioning! Its dynamic capture system calculates three thousand times per second. It can predict your next move through tiny muscle twitches! In its eyes, your movements are in slow motion!"

*Bzzt—!*

Another sword swing came.

Though Lin Yi tried desperately to dodge, his right leg was still grazed by the sword energy, tactical pants instantly tearing, leaving a scorched bloody mark on his skin.

"Its algorithm is based on 'survival logic.'"

Su Liang shouted. "It calculates that you'll dodge fatal injuries, so all its attacks are used to block your evasion routes, forcing you into a dead end!"

Lin Yi gasped, leaning against a broken stone pillar.

As long as he was human, as long as he wanted to live, his instincts would drive him to avoid death. And this machine was using humanity's survival instinct to weave a net of certain death.

"Survival logic, huh..."

Lin Yi looked at the black reaper approaching step by step, a glint of madness flashing in his eyes.

"If it were a normal person, they really couldn't win."

"But what about a madman?"

He took a deep breath, not retreating but stepping out from cover, facing that invincible steel giant head-on.

## Section 3: Self-Sacrifice

【Warning: Target abandoning cover. Behavioral logic anomalous.】

A string of red data streams flashed through the Arbiter's single eye. In its algorithm, Lin Yi's current behavior was equivalent to suicide.

"Delete."

The Arbiter raised its right arm. That meter-long high-frequency vibration sword emitted a piercing hum, the air distorted by high-frequency vibrations.

It locked onto Lin Yi's heart.

According to calculations, the target had a 99.8% probability of rolling right to evade. So its left hand was already charged, ready to smash Lin Yi into pulp the moment he rolled.

But.

Lin Yi didn't move.

**[Trait Activated: Pain Blocking (Remaining time: 2 minutes)]**

The moment that sword capable of cutting through tanks thrust forward, Lin Yi didn't go right or left. He suddenly stepped forward, slightly turning his body.

Not to dodge, but to... accommodate.

*Squelch—!!!*

A teeth-grinding sound of bone and flesh separating.

The high-frequency vibration sword didn't pierce his heart, but effortlessly penetrated Lin Yi's left shoulder. High temperature instantly cauterized the wound, collarbone and scapula pulverized by the vibration.

If in normal state, this pain would be enough to instantly cause shock.

But at this moment, Lin Yi didn't even furrow his brow.

【Logic Error: Target did not evade fatal damage.】

The Arbiter's movements froze for 0.1 seconds. Because in its database, no human would actively use their body to "eat" a high-frequency sword.

This 0.1 seconds was the boundary between life and death.

"Got you."

Lin Yi not only didn't retreat, but let his body continue forward along the blade. His intact right hand clamped like an iron vice onto the Arbiter's sword-wielding wrist.

His body became the sheath locking this weapon.

His bones became the grit jamming the gears.

At this moment, the distance between them was—zero.

## Section 4: Logic Collapse

The Arbiter's massive single eye was right in front of Lin Yi, red light flashing madly inside, seemingly recalculating this sudden turn of events.

"Only steel, no understanding of pain, right?"

Lin Yi's mouth was full of blood, yet he revealed an extremely savage smile. "Too bad, in this system, pain is the greatest power."

His right hand released the gun, reaching back to pull out that black metal fragment he'd kept close to his body—【Fragment of Reality】.

This fragment crashed off Ark's gate was itself a BUG in this virtual world, a scalpel cutting through lies.

"Crash... for me!"

Lin Yi roared, viciously stabbing the fragment into the Arbiter's crimson single eye.

*Bzzzzt—!!!*

The moment the fragment pierced the core processor, no engine oil flowed out—instead, a burst of dazzling green garbled code exploded.

That was the collapse of underlying logic.

【Critical Error! Core logic conflict!】
【Unknown data intrusion detected... anger... fear... despair...】

Lin Yi didn't just stab once. Through this fragment, he injected all the negative emotions from his journey—being bitten by zombies, dissecting himself, being deceived by fake people—into this cold machine.

The Arbiter emitted a shrill electronic screech.

Its massive body began convulsing violently, originally smooth movements becoming stiff and chaotic. It tried to pull out the sword, but Lin Yi's body was like a stubborn stone, firmly jamming it.

"You only have steel..."

Lin Yi pressed against the Arbiter's ear, his voice hoarse as a demon. "But I have rage."

*BOOM!*

Accompanied by a final explosion-like short circuit sound, the red light in the Arbiter's eye completely extinguished. Its massive body lost power, like a pile of scrap metal, heavily kneeling before Lin Yi.

Lin Yi pulled out the fragment, kicked away this scrap metal, then gritting his teeth, slowly pulled out the high-frequency sword stuck in his shoulder.

Though pain was blocked, that sensation of his body being hollowed out still made him dizzy.

"Lin Yi!"

Su Liang rushed up from behind, supporting his swaying form. Looking at that terrifying penetrating wound, her hands trembled. "You're insane... this arm will be crippled!"

"Won't be crippled."

Lin Yi glanced at the still-smoking wound. "As long as I don't die, I can fix it back at the transit station. Before that..."

He raised his head, looking at that now-unguarded gate.

"This is the ticket to the top floor."
