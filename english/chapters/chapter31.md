# Chapter 31: Neon and Rust

## Section 1: Rising Stench of Corpses

The gear engagement sound of the freight elevator echoed in the sealed shaft, like a giant beast swallowing.

As the floor numbers jumped—F District, E District, D District—the nauseating smell of burnt corpses and engine oil gradually faded, replaced by a cheap air freshener scent. It was "Ocean Breeze" mixed with chemical fragrances, attempting to mask the rotting stench from the city's lower levels, but the result was like spraying perfume on a corpse, making it even more nauseating.

"Put on your helmet."

Lin Yi leaned in the elevator corner, checking the P-19 kinetic pistol in his hand, then fastened the black riot helmet stripped from a security officer's corpse onto his head.

Su Liang also put on her helmet. She now looked like a lean SWAT officer. Though this getup worked well in the lower levels, once they reached the upper levels...

"Ding—"

The elevator stopped at C District: Middle Commercial Corridor.

The heavy metal doors slid open to both sides.

In that instant, the two who had grown accustomed to the dim lighting of the lower levels instinctively squinted.

Too bright.

The overwhelming neon light pollution surged in like a tsunami. Pink, cyan, bright purple holographic projections filled every inch of space. Massive virtual billboards floated in the air, displaying a virtual idol with a perfect smile, tirelessly looping that slogan:

【Happiness is duty. Melancholy is virus. Praise Father, praise Perfect City.】

Lin Yi observed this bizarre world through the helmet's one-way visor with cold eyes.

This was a vertical cyber maze. Countless transparent aerial walkways connected densely packed skyscrapers, flying cars queuing along predetermined tracks.

And on the streets, crowds of well-dressed "citizens" filled the space.

They wore neat uniforms, faces bearing the same happy smiles as the billboards, mechanically queuing at various shops, purchasing beautifully packaged synthetic foods.

"Looks prosperous." Su Liang's voice came through the helmet's communication channel, carrying a hint of mockery.

"Gilded exterior."

Lin Yi stepped out of the elevator, the floor tiles beneath his feet changing from rusted steel plates to smooth composite material. "This is still a pig pen, just with luxury renovation."

## Section 2: Synthetic Happiness

The two blended into the bustling crowd.

Wearing this black security officer armor, surrounding civilians gave way, their eyes showing a mixture of awe and fearful submission. This saved them the trouble of stealth.

Passing a restaurant called "Happy Taste Buds," Lin Yi glanced through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Inside, customers were enjoying their "feast."

The plates contained a green paste that looked no different from the inferior protein paste in the lower levels, just with a synthetic mint leaf stuck on top and a glass of bubbling colored beverage beside it.

But those people ate with relish.

With each bite, their expressions became more intoxicated, as if savoring Michelin three-star cuisine.

"Their taste has been deceived."

Lin Yi said in a low voice. "Neural plugs in the back of their heads. The system directly tells them through neural signals 'this tastes good,' and their brains produce dopamine. Even if it's shit, they'll think it's chocolate."

"True electronic drugs." Su Liang commented.

Just then, the holographic screen in the street center suddenly switched.

A kind, fatherly middle-aged male face appeared. This was the city's mainframe—【Father】.

"Children, good afternoon."

Father's voice was warm and magnetic. "Today's happiness index is 98.5%. Two rats from F District have gotten lost... If we see them, please gently guide them to the correction center. After all, lost children are in pain."

The screen displayed photos of Lin Yi and Su Liang (wearing lower-level cleaner uniforms).

The street atmosphere instantly changed.

Those citizens who had been immersed in food and shopping stopped their actions in perfect unison.

Thousands of eyes, bearing that eerie smile, began searching through the crowd.

"Wanted notice issued fast." Lin Yi gripped the gun hidden under his cloak. "Let's go, to the upper level passage."

## Section 3: Data Tinnitus

"Wait."

Su Liang suddenly grabbed Lin Yi's arm with surprising strength.

"Don't go forward."

Her voice was somewhat pained, as if enduring some extremely high-frequency noise. "The intersection ahead... is noisy."

"Noisy?" Lin Yi looked ahead—there were only a few engineering robots maintaining streetlights, no commotion.

"Not sound... data."

Su Liang pressed her temples through the helmet. "My ears... can hear the logic of electrical currents. That camera ahead is zooming. And those robots... their underlying directives changed."

In Su Liang's auditory world, this city was no longer visual images, but a chaotic electronic ocean.

*Bzzt... locking target characteristics...*

*Beep... weapon system warming up...*

*Hum... uploading coordinate data...*

These electronic signals produced faint electromagnetic oscillations during air transmission, which through her ears enhanced by the "Lightless Hospital," became tangible sounds.

"That's an ambush."

Su Liang pointed at the seemingly calm intersection ahead. "Those three engineering robots aren't holding wrenches—they're high-frequency cutting blades disguised as tools. And behind that rotating billboard, there's an automatic gun turret. I heard its servo motor turning."

Lin Yi didn't doubt her at all.

If he was the violent virus, Su Liang was now the scanner that could see firewall vulnerabilities.

"Which way?"

"Right." Su Liang pointed to a narrow maintenance passage. "It's quiet there. Only rat heartbeats, no data current sounds."

The two quickly turned and slipped into that dark alley.

Less than five seconds after they left.

The engineering robots at that intersection suddenly tore off their disguises, their tools transforming into spinning saw blades, wildly swinging at empty air. The billboard flipped, revealing dark gun muzzles.

If they'd forced their way through, they'd be riddled with holes by now.

## Section 4: Wireless Ghost

Through the maintenance passage, they reached a relatively hidden ventilation machine room.

Massive fan blades roared, masking their conversation.

"Temporarily safe."

Lin Yi removed his helmet, wiping cold sweat from his forehead. But this sweat wasn't from exertion—it was from a headache.

A familiar, heavy sensation like someone pouring lead into his brain was attacking.

【Warning: Wireless signal intrusion detected】

【Assimilation Rate: 0.5%... 0.8%...】

The red warning box popped up on his retina again.

"Damn it."

Lin Yi cursed. He'd clearly used the [Fragment of Reality] to sever the physical connection cable behind his head—why was the assimilation rate still rising?

"What's wrong?" Su Liang noticed his distress.

"Wi-Fi."

Lin Yi pointed at the ubiquitous signal towers overhead. "This city itself is a massive wireless charger. Except it's not charging electricity—it's charging brainwashing signals. As long as we're in this tower, even with the cable unplugged, it's continuously radiating us to make us 'submit.'"

Though the rise was much slower than when plugged in, it was like chronic poisoning.

At this rate, in about 24 hours, their assimilation rate would exceed the critical threshold, they'd start hallucinating, thinking "Father" was right, thinking resistance was painful.

"We don't have time to infiltrate slowly."

Lin Yi put the helmet back on, the killing intent in his eyes brighter than those neon lights.

"We must reach the top before our brains break."

He pulled out the P-19 pistol from his waist, checking the magazine. Two boxes of armor-piercing rounds remained.

"Su Liang, listen for where the loudest noise is."

"What?"

"Wherever the data flow is densest, wherever the defenses are strictest, that's where we go." Lin Yi said coldly. "The elevator to the upper level must be where the monsters are most concentrated."

Su Liang closed her eyes, listening intently for a moment.

Then she pointed overhead, at that magnificent aerial pavilion suspended in C District's center.

"There."

Su Liang opened her eyes. "The noise there... is deafening. There's a massive creature with a heartbeat like a hydraulic press."

"That's the gatekeeper."

Lin Yi chambered a round with a click.

"Let's go silence it."
