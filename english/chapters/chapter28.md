# Chapter 28: Welcome to the Future

## Section 1: Disinfectant and Gun Muzzles

Tinnitus.
The world consisted only of sharp, continuous ringing, like a red-hot steel needle frantically stirring in the auditory nerve. Lin Yi struggled to open his eyes, which had been glued shut by blood from the crash, his retinas filled with jumping spots of light.
Bodily sensation was slowly returning—pain more unbearable than the moment of impact. Probably three broken ribs; each breath felt like his chest cavity was stuffed with broken glass.
"Sample confirmed alive. Vital signs weak, but above threshold."
A cold, emotionless voice sounded overhead.
Lin Yi moved his fingers, trying to reach for the gun at his waist, only to discover his hands had been tightly bound by high-strength restraints. He'd been dragged like a dead dog from the deformed, burning locomotive wreckage and thrown onto the cold metal floor.
He struggled to lift his head.
Before him was a row of dark gun muzzles.
These weren't the old-fashioned kinetic rifles seen on the train, but electromagnetic pulse rifles belonging to Ark's regular army that he'd seen in the "Lightless Hospital" database. The soldiers holding the guns wore fully sealed white exoskeleton armor, opaque face masks showing no faces, only blue data streams flickering on the masks.
"This is... the welcoming ceremony?"
Lin Yi spat out a mouthful of bloody saliva, the corner of his mouth curling into a bleak smile.
Though he'd long guessed the Ark wasn't heaven, this reception was still more "enthusiastic" than expected.
Su Liang lay not far from him, apparently still unconscious. The surviving mechanic and doctor knelt on the ground, trembling all over, being forcibly scanned by two soldiers pressing their heads down.
"Silence."
A soldier who appeared to be a commander stepped forward, using his gun barrel to lift Lin Yi's chin. "This is Ark One · First Quarantine Zone. According to the 'Human Genetic Purification Act,' all returnees from the wasteland must undergo decontamination processing."

## Section 2: Parts Factory

The so-called "decontamination" wasn't a bath.
Lin Yi and Su Liang were forcibly lifted and pushed onto a hovering transport platform. The platform glided at high speed along a bright, endless white corridor.
Through the transparent isolation walls on both sides, Lin Yi finally saw the true face of this legendary "last bastion of humanity"—Ark One.
There were no idyllic ecological gardens, no peaceful survivor communities.
This was simply a massive, suffocatingly precise factory.
In those transparent cylinders dozens of meters high, countless pale human bodies floated. Some missing limbs, some with heads full of tubes, others seemingly being "cultivated," their abdomens connected to thick nutrient tubes.
Countless mechanical arms shuttled between these cultivation chambers, harvesting needed organs like crops, or injecting new genetic agents.
"This is... the future?"
Su Liang had awakened at some point. Looking at the scene outside the window, her voice was hoarse, her eyes full of shock. "They're treating people... like parts?"
"Not just parts."
Lin Yi stared at a distant assembly line. There, several technicians in white coats were extracting a fresh brain from a skull, skillfully installing it into a metal casing—just like the one they'd escorted on the train.
"This is a processing plant."
Lin Yi said coldly. "That so-called 'Human Instrumentality Project' isn't about helping humanity survive on the wasteland at all. It's about transforming humans into forms more suitable for mechanical operation... wetware."
The Ark didn't need people. The Ark only needed "biological CPUs" and "organic batteries."

## Section 3: Last Words

The transport platform stopped before a door marked [Core Recovery Zone].
The life support chamber that had miraculously survived the crash—the jar containing the "Navigator" brain—was roughly unloaded by several engineering robots.
The container was already cracked, pink nutrient solution pooling on the floor. The brain, due to oxygen deprivation and shock, was convulsing violently.
"Cargo delivered. Damage rate 45%, still recoverable."
A technician stepped forward, pulling out a thick data cable, preparing to directly insert it into the brain's interface to read data.
"No..."
An extremely weak wail, transmitted directly through brainwaves vibrating the air, sounded.
That brain's eyes that wouldn't close in death miraculously focused at this moment. It didn't look at the technicians dismantling it, but stared fixedly at Lin Yi being escorted nearby.
*Crackle... crackle...*
Lin Yi's mind suddenly exploded with electrical static.
[Danger Sense] didn't alarm. Because this wasn't an attack—this was a final gift.
In that instant, Lin Yi felt his consciousness forcibly pulled into a brief connection. He "saw" this brain's memories from life—a young pilot who joined the Ark project with dreams of saving his family, then was anesthetized, had his skull sawed open, and became this monster that could only calculate coordinates.
"Listen..."
That voice roared in Lin Yi's mind, carrying the determination of a dying flash.
"The Observer... is lying..."
"There's no savior at all... the Ark is... the devourer..."
"Break... break that... dome..."
*Snap.*
A soft sound.
The technician pulled out the connection cable, casually cutting off the brain's supply pump. Those eyes full of resentment and despair rapidly lost their luster, becoming dull gray-white like dead fish.
"Data export complete. Waste disposal."
The technician waved his hand, tossing what had once been a human hero into the nearby incinerator chute like garbage.
Lin Yi stared fixedly at that lump of rotten meat sliding into darkness, his fists clenched until his knuckles turned white.
He didn't shout, didn't resist. He simply carved this scene, along with that brain's final words, deep into his bones.
The Observer is lying.
This isn't just a trial. This is captivity.

## Section 4: S-Rank Evaluation

White light descended.
Ark's suffocating white corridors, soldiers' gun muzzles, and the incinerator's flames all collapsed and dissipated in that instant.
Familiar weightlessness struck.
When Lin Yi opened his eyes again, he was back in that absolutely pure, absolutely safe white transit station.
The wounds on his body were healing, broken ribs reconnecting under the light beam's illumination.
But the chill in his heart was even more bone-piercing than on that eternal night train.
【Fourth Dungeon: Eternal Night Train (Complete)】
The system's cold settlement voice sounded on schedule, this time seeming to carry a barely perceptible note of approval.
【Settlement Status】
Sample No. 17 (Lin Yi):
【Basic Mission】: Escort cargo to destination (Complete).
【Special Decision】: Severing tail for survival (Judged as extremely rational).
【Casualty Rate】: Team survival 4/6 (Better than average).
【Overall Rating】: S-Rank.
"Congratulations."
The Observer's light and shadow materialized in midair, its tone carrying a kind of lofty satisfaction. "You made the most correct choice. In that situation, sacrificing the weak to preserve the core is a leader's only logic."
"Leader?"
Lin Yi stood up from the ground, moving his newly repaired shoulder. He looked at the Observer, his eyes no longer containing the initial confusion and fear, only a bottomless pitch black.
"So-called leaders are people who send their own kind into incinerators?"
The Observer fell silent for a moment.
"For civilization's continuation, necessary sacrifices are noble."
"Fuck your nobility."
Lin Yi cursed internally, but his face showed no expression. He knew that right now, he was still too weak. Before that massive Ark, he didn't even count as an ant.
He needed to become stronger.
Stronger than monsters, more ruthless than the Ark.
Until one day, he could personally smash that glass dome and drag these lofty "Observers" down from their altar.
"Settlement rewards." Lin Yi said coldly.
【Gene [Nirvana] Unlock Rate increased to: 25%】
【New Trait Acquired: Pain Blocking (Active)】—You can actively sever neural pain transmission, duration 5 minutes. Side effect: After ending, pain will return doubled.
【Item Acquired: Ark Pass (Damaged)】—The car key that crashed into the gate.
Lin Yi looked at the small piece of twisted metal in his hand—a fragment that had flown off when the locomotive crashed into Ark's gate.
"Break the dome, huh..."
Lin Yi gripped the fragment tightly, its sharp edge piercing his palm, but he didn't frown.
"Su Liang." He turned to look at the woman beside him who had just finished repairs and was rubbing her temples.
"What?" Su Liang looked at him warily.
"Get ready."
Lin Yi's mouth curled into a mad smile. "Next stop, we're going to kill our way through this game."
