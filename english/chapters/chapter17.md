# Chapter 17: The Person in the Mirror

## Section 1: Delayed Blink

The shock of the tattooed man's "rebirth" made the air in the apartment even more viscous.

After returning to Room 404, Su Liang immediately locked the door and used a chair to brace the doorknob. She sat in the corner of the sofa, face pale, tightly gripping the tactical knife, her knuckles white from excessive force.

"Don't be nervous."

Lin Yi stood at the bathroom door, holding a piece of dark, thick curtain fabric. "As long as we don't violate the rules, they can't directly attack us for now. That tattooed man was 'replaced' because he ran on the stairs last night and violated the rules."

Although he said this to comfort her, Lin Yi's own heart was equally uncertain.

He walked into the bathroom, preparing to seal off the last mirror.

[Rule 4: There are no mirrors in the apartment. If you discover a mirror in your room, please immediately cover it with cloth and do not gaze into the mirror for more than 10 seconds.]

This mirror was large, occupying the entire wall above the sink. Yesterday, unable to find a large enough cloth, they'd hastily covered it with newspaper. But now, those newspapers had started peeling off from moisture, exposing a corner of the mirror surface.

Lin Yi reached out to tear off the damp newspapers.

*Rip.*

As the newspaper fell, the mirror surface was completely exposed.

Lin Yi subconsciously glanced at himself in the mirror.

Face somewhat haggard, heavy bags under his eyes, blue stubble on his chin. Those eyes were filled with bloodshot veins—proof of long-term mental tension.

"Looks fairly normal..."

Lin Yi was about to cover it with the cloth when his movement suddenly froze.

His gaze locked onto the eyes of that "Lin Yi" in the mirror.

He didn't know why, but he felt that gaze somewhat unfamiliar. That feeling was like looking at a stranger who didn't belong to himself.

To verify a certain suspicion, Lin Yi faced the mirror and quickly blinked his left eye.

The reflection in the mirror also blinked its left eye.

But... it was slow.

Although it was only an extremely small delay, less than 0.1 seconds, as a gaming expert extremely sensitive to frame rates, Lin Yi caught that instant of frame drop.

"Network lag?"

An absurd thought popped into Lin Yi's mind.

He took a deep breath and made another movement: he suddenly raised his right hand, making a grasping motion.

This time, the delay was even more obvious.

The "Lin Yi" in the mirror was half a beat slow in raising his hand. And when that reflection's hand rose, the corner of its mouth eerily... curved upward slightly.

That wasn't Lin Yi's expression.

That was a greedy, ecstatic expression of finally connecting to the server.

## Section 2: Embrace Without Killing Intent

"Su Liang! Bring tape! Quick!"

Lin Yi shouted in a low voice, wanting to cover it with the cloth.

But just then, a mutation occurred.

The "Lin Yi" in the mirror didn't retract his hand like a physical reflection should, but maintained that grasping posture and actually penetrated through the mirror surface, reaching toward the real Lin Yi!

That hand was pale, cold, its surface covered with a layer of mercury-like fluid substance.

Lin Yi instinctively wanted to retreat.

But he was horrified to discover that his [Danger Sense] was completely silent!

No tingling.

No warning.

In his sixth sense, this monster crawling out of the mirror had no hostility toward him. It was like a long-separated family member, opening its arms wanting to give him an embrace.

"Come home... we'll become one..."

A voice rang directly in his mind. That wasn't language, but a pure data stream, carrying an ultimate temptation and warmth.

That feeling was too comfortable.

Like a person frozen stiff in icy weather suddenly being immersed in a hot spring. Lin Yi's originally tense nerves actually wanted to relax in that instant. He even had an absurd thought: As long as I grasp that hand, I can be liberated, I can become "perfect."

"No!"

"That's fake!"

Lin Yi fiercely bit his tongue, the intense coppery taste instantly sobering him.

At this moment, that mercury-like hand had already grabbed his collar, enormous force dragging him toward the mirror.

The mirror surface rippled like water, Lin Yi feeling his upper body losing sensation, as if being digitized, decomposed into countless 0s and 1s.

"Get back!!"

Lin Yi roared.

He didn't try to pry open that hand—because that hand's strength was astonishingly great.

He made a more direct decision.

He suddenly swung his right elbow, using all his strength, viciously smashing it toward that mirror.

## Section 3: Real Blood

*Crash—!!*

The crisp sound of shattering exploded in the cramped bathroom.

The mirror surface instantly shattered under Lin Yi's elbow strike, exploding into countless sharp fragments.

"Ahhh—!!"

A piercing scream like electrical overload came from the mirror.

That hand grasping Lin Yi's collar instantly disintegrated, turning into a puddle of black sticky liquid spilling on the ground, rapidly evaporating, leaving only a pungent smell like burnt circuit boards.

Lin Yi staggered backward, hitting the door frame, gasping heavily.

His right arm had several deep wounds from the glass, deep enough to see bone, blood dripping onto the ground.

Su Liang rushed in holding tape.

Seeing the ground covered with glass shards and the blood on Lin Yi's arm, she froze.

"What happened?!"

"Don't touch those fragments!" Lin Yi shouted.

He picked up a larger mirror fragment. In that fragment, his face was still reflected, but this time, that reflection no longer had a delay, nor that eerie smile.

That was a genuine physical reflection.

"They're synchronizing data through mirrors."

Lin Yi covered his bleeding arm, his face terrifyingly grim. "That thing just now... it wanted to overwrite me. If I'd been pulled in, the current me would become the reflection in the mirror, and it would walk out, becoming the 'perfect' Lin Yi."

"Most terrifying is..."

Lin Yi looked at Su Liang, deep fear in his eyes. "My [Danger Sense] had no reaction. It didn't think this was killing me. It thought this was... optimizing me."

This was the terrifying nature of [False People].

They weren't killing. They were "debugging."

In their logic, humans full of flaws, diseases, and negative emotions were low-version programs, and they were the more advanced 2.0 version. Replacement was a merciful upgrade.

"Cover all reflective things."

Lin Yi straightened his body, letting blood flow freely, that genuine stabbing pain making him feel incredibly reassured. "TV screens, window glass, even stainless steel kettles... cover them all."

"In this hellish place, only pain can prove I'm real."

Su Liang nodded, didn't ask more questions, and immediately got to work.

But at the moment she turned around, her gaze lingered on Lin Yi's bleeding arm for a second.

That look was complex.

Both worried about Lin Yi's injury reducing his combat capability, and also a trace of... imperceptible relief.

Good thing what flowed out was bright red blood, not black motor oil.

He was still human.
