# **Chapter 7: Absolute Darkness**

## **Section 1: Death Sentence for Light**

The teleportation didn't feel as disorienting as expected.

It was like being pressed into the deep sea by an invisible giant hand. The pure white transfer station vanished instantly, replaced by a suffocating, thick darkness.

Lin Yi opened his eyes.

Nothing.

Even when he widened his eyes until the corners ached, his retinas couldn't capture even a single photon. This wasn't the darkness of a room with the lights off—that kind of darkness still let you see blurry outlines. This darkness was absolute nothingness, as if his optic nerves had been severed by a scalpel.

"Visual module... disabled?"

Lin Yi instinctively tried to raise his hand to touch his face, but stopped mid-air.

Because his nose, before his hand, had already captured information about the environment.

It was an extremely complex smell. The top layer was the sharp scent of formalin and disinfectant, cold and chemical. But beneath that lurked an old, sweet smell of mold, and... that faint, barely noticeable rusty smell.

Blood. Old blood that had seeped into the cracks of the walls.

*Bzzt...*

A crackling sound reached his ears—the system's notification tone acting directly on his auditory nerves.

**[Welcome to the Two-Star Instance: Lightless Hospital]**

**[Current Environmental Illumination: 0 Lux]**

**[Warning: In this place, eyes will deceive you. Only ears are honest.]**

After the voice faded, the darkness returned to deathly silence.

But this silence didn't last long.

"Hello? Anyone there?"

A trembling male voice suddenly rang out about five meters to Lin Yi's left front. The voice carried obvious panic and a crying tone on the verge of collapse. "My screen went black? Is my graphics card broken? Can anyone hear me?"

Lin Yi didn't make a sound.

After experiencing the life-and-death trial of the first instance, "Abandoned School," every cell in his body had memorized "Survival Rule Number One": In an unknown environment, revealing your position equals suicide.

He slowly crouched down, hugging his knees, trying to minimize his target area. He took off his shoes, standing barefoot on the cold tiles.

The sensation was slippery and sticky. The tiles seemed covered with a thin layer of grease or some kind of bacterial mat.

"Say something! I know someone's there!" The newbie kept shouting, his voice echoing in the spacious hall, triggering a series of eerie echoes. "I'm 'Berserker God,' I have beta access! Who's there? Let's team up!"

Besides this newbie, there were several other suppressed breathing sounds in the darkness.

Lin Yi keenly distinguished them. At his seven o'clock position to the right rear, there was heavy, rapid breathing—sounded like a big guy. At nine o'clock, there was an extremely faint, deliberately suppressed heartbeat—that was an expert, or at least someone smart.

That "Berserker God" was clearly a real rookie, or rather, he still thought he was playing an ordinary VR game.

"Damn it, what a broken game, not even fixing the lighting bugs..."

The newbie seemed to be fumbling around blindly in the darkness, his footsteps chaotic, kicking a metal waiting chair.

*CLANG!*

The loud noise was like thunder in the silent darkness.

Lin Yi's heart contracted sharply. He almost instinctively held his breath, every muscle tensing.

Even though he couldn't see, his instincts were screaming: something had been awakened.

## **Section 2: Wet Tearing Sounds**

The air in the hall suddenly began to move.

Not wind, but the faint airflow created by something moving quickly.

The newbie who had been cursing suddenly stopped.

"Who?" His voice became shrill. "Who's touching my neck?"

No one answered.

In the darkness, Lin Yi heard a strange sound.

Not footsteps, not breathing. It was... like the faint sound of dry bone joints rubbing against each other.

*Click... click...*

The sound was extremely soft—it would definitely be ignored normally. But in this deathly silence, it was as clear as if it were right next to his ear.

It came from directly above the newbie.

"Get away! Stop playing tricks!" The newbie clearly sensed something was wrong. He swung his arms, creating whooshing sounds. "I have pain blocking! I'm not afraid of you!"

If this were the Lin Yi from the first instance, he might have warned him.

But the current Lin Yi just coldly pressed his body lower, reducing even his breathing rate to the minimum.

*Click.*

The bone-rubbing sound stopped.

Then came an extremely wet, teeth-grinding tearing sound.

*SQUELCH—!*

Like someone tearing apart a freshly roasted chicken with their bare hands, or forcefully ripping apart a water-soaked sponge.

The newbie's cursing stopped abruptly.

No scream. Perhaps because his vocal cords were severed in the first instant.

Only a rapid, bellows-like gasping sound remained—*heh... heh...*—the sound of large amounts of liquid flooding into the trachea.

Then came the dull thud of a heavy object hitting the ground.

*Thump.*

But this wasn't the end.

In the following seconds, Lin Yi was forced to listen to a complete ASMR performance called "Feeding."

Chewing sounds.

The crisp sound of cartilage being crushed.

And that gulping sound of swallowing thick liquid.

Suddenly, a drop of warm liquid splattered over, landing precisely on Lin Yi's cheek.

In that instant, Lin Yi's body instinctively wanted to shudder, wanted to wipe away that nauseating slime. But he forcibly controlled himself.

His brain was screaming: Don't move! Don't wipe! Don't make a sound!

He remained crouched like a stone statue, letting that drop of rusty-smelling liquid slide down his cheek and flow to the corner of his mouth. He kept his mouth tightly shut, tasting a hint of saltiness.

Blood.

That newbie's blood.

"What... is that thing..."

Though Lin Yi couldn't see, his mind had already sketched a horrifying picture: an invisible monster, hanging upside down from the ceiling or crouching beside the corpse, enjoying its prey.

It made no roar, not even heavy breathing. It was like a precision killing machine—quiet, efficient, cruel.

If that newbie hadn't made noise just now...

If someone had panicked and fled after that loud crash...

Lin Yi felt a wave of fear. The rules of this instance were already very clear, no need for the system to provide any text explanation.

This was a blind person's world.

Noise was a death sentence.

In the darkness, the chewing sounds gradually stopped.

The monster seemed full, or had lost interest in the corpse.

*Click... click...*

That bone-rubbing sound rang out again. This time, it moved toward the depths of the hall, gradually fading until it completely disappeared.

A full minute passed.

The hall remained deathly silent. The remaining survivors seemed to have reached some kind of tacit understanding through this silent execution.

No one spoke, no one moved.

Until a low, hoarse voice filled with suppressed anger broke the silence.

"Stop playing dead, everyone."

The speaker was that big guy at seven o'clock (the one with heavy breathing).

"If you don't want to end up like that idiot and become monster food, report your positions. We need a light source."

Lin Yi didn't respond immediately.

He slightly tilted his head in the darkness, his ears moving. He was waiting for the reaction of that "smart person" at nine o'clock.

A few seconds later, a cool female voice spoke up from the nine o'clock direction.

"I advise you not to turn on any lights."

Her voice was light and steady, without a trace of fear. "If I were you, I'd take off my shoes first."

Lin Yi's lips curved slightly in the darkness.

An expert.

This instance just got interesting.
