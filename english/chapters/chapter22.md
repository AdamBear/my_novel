# Chapter 22: Reflection of History

## Section 1: The Blade of Minus Fifty-Two Degrees

The howling wind was like countless invisible dull knives, viciously scraping every inch of exposed skin. That pain sensation even surpassed the cold itself, directly evolving into an agony similar to having bones sanded down. This was the power of pain perception locked at one hundred percent. On the extreme cold wasteland of minus fifty-two degrees, every second of breathing felt like swallowing broken glass. Lin Yi lay prone on the anti-slip steel plate of the train roof, feeling his expensive polar tactical suit rapidly losing temperature, his goggles instantly frosting over with a thick layer of white.

"Get down! Find an entrance quickly!"

Lin Yi had to shout at the top of his lungs, his voice torn to shreds by the howling wind the moment it left his mouth. Su Liang beside him curled into a ball. Though her Kevlar stab-proof vest had excellent defensive capabilities, its insulation was clearly inferior to Lin Yi's equipment. Ice had already formed on her eyebrows, her whole body trembling violently, movements stiff as a rusted puppet. They couldn't stay on top any longer. According to the system's warning, leaving a heat source for one hundred eighty seconds would result in freezing death, and they'd already consumed at least thirty seconds. Lin Yi hesitated no longer. Like a gecko climbing in a storm, he dragged Su Liang and crawled against the gale toward the carriage connection. There was a pressurized hatch for maintenance.

"Hold tight!"

Lin Yi gripped the hatch handle with one hand and twisted with all his strength. The hydraulic rod let out a dull hiss, the heavy iron door cracked open a gap, and a wave of heat carrying the smell of engine oil instantly gushed out. The two tumbled and rolled into that dark opening. With a loud clang, the hatch slammed shut, isolating the roaring blizzard and eternal night in another world.

## Section 2: Carriage Number Nine

The moment they fell into the carriage, Lin Yi felt like he'd returned from hell to the human world. Warm air enveloped his body, almost making him moan with comfort. But this relaxation lasted only half a second before the kinetic pistol in his hand was already raised, the muzzle coldly pointed toward the carriage interior. This was a narrow space full of industrial punk style, with exposed brass pipes everywhere and valves constantly spraying steam. The air was thick with the heavy smell of engine oil and burning coal. In the center of the carriage sat a huge black metal container wrapped in countless cables, printed with a faded federal emblem. And around the container, four people were already standing.

"Don't shoot! We're on the same side!"

The speaker was a young man in a white coat wearing gold-rimmed glasses, looking like a doctor. He held up both hands, wearing a friendly, even somewhat ingratiating smile. Behind him cowered a short man covered in grease, clutching a large wrench tightly in his hands, currently shaking like a sieve. The other two were grim-faced burly men holding system-issued standard rifles, warily sizing up Lin Yi and Su Liang who had descended from above.

【Current Location: Federal Transport Train - Armed Carriage No. 9】
【Faction Assignment Complete: Federal Guard (6 people total)】
【Mission Objective: Defend Carriage No. 9 and core cargo until the train reaches Ark One.】
【Warning: Hostile faction "Raiders" have infiltrated the rear of the train, 6 people.】

The red text on his retina explained the current situation. These four people were teammates. Lin Yi didn't lower his gun, but coldly surveyed the area, his gaze finally settling on the seemingly harmless doctor.

"Who's the team leader?"

Lin Yi asked, his voice somewhat hoarse from the cold wind.

"No... no team leader."

The short mechanic stammered in, "We just got teleported in too. The system didn't say anything, just told us to guard this box."

"That's good."

Lin Yi lowered his muzzle, but his finger remained on the trigger guard. He walked to the huge black container and patted its cold metal shell. "Since there's no team leader, from now on, I'm the captain. Any objections?"

The two burly men exchanged glances. Just as one was about to say something, Su Liang suddenly stepped out from behind Lin Yi. She removed her goggles, revealing those cold eyes. The high-frequency vibration dagger in her hand spun in a dazzling flourish at her fingertips, emitting a buzzing hum.

"I don't recommend you have objections."

Su Liang's voice was light, but carried an aura of having just crawled out from mountains of corpses and seas of blood. "We just killed the Boss of the last dungeon. We're not in a good mood."

The two burly men saw Lin Yi's professional polar equipment and Su Liang's skilled killing techniques, and wisely shut their mouths. In this world, equipment and presence often represented survival rate.

## Section 3: Non-Combustible Garbage

"Introduce yourselves. I don't remember names, only functions."

Lin Yi leaned against the container and began organizing the team. This was a faction war. Incompetent teammates were more terrifying than godlike opponents. He had to figure out these people's capabilities before battle began.

"I'm a doctor, Sample No. 105."

The young man with glasses spoke first. He pulled out a first aid kit from his bag to show them. "I have the [Basic Healing] talent. I can treat external injuries and stop bleeding, but I... I'm not good at fighting."

"I'm a mechanic, Sample No. 204."

The short man hugged his wrench, shrinking his neck. "I can fix things. The valve on this train was leaking earlier and I tightened it. I'm also... I'm also afraid of dying."

The remaining two burly men—one was a veteran with [Combat Mastery], the other a mercenary skilled in heavy firepower. The configuration was fairly balanced: one commander (Lin Yi), one radar (Su Liang), two meat shield fighters, one healer, one logistics.

"Good."

Lin Yi nodded, his gaze coldly sweeping over the doctor and mechanic. "Listen, our mission is to guard this box. During the upcoming journey, there will definitely be enemies trying to steal it, and those mechanical monsters trying to dismantle the train."

He pointed at the floor beneath his feet—the carriage floor vibrating at high speed.

"This is a high-speed train. Outside is a minus fifty-degree death zone. If the carriage breaks or the heating stops, we'll all become ice sculptures."

"So in this carriage, any excess compassion and fear are garbage."

Lin Yi walked up to the doctor and stared into his eyes, that gaze sharp as if dissecting. "Especially you, doctor. If enemies attack, I don't want to see you asking if they're in pain before shooting. Here, hesitation means defeat, mercy means suicide."

The doctor smiled awkwardly and pushed up his glasses. "I'll try, I'll try."

"Not try—must."

Lin Yi turned around, looking toward the darkness at the carriage connection. Su Liang stood there, head tilted, seemingly listening to strange sounds mixed in the blizzard.

"They're here."

Su Liang suddenly spoke, her voice tense. "There's sound on the roof. Very heavy, not human footsteps. That's... the sound of metal claws scraping on metal."

"Prepare for battle!"

Lin Yi pulled the bolt, a bloodthirsty gleam flashing in his eyes. "Everyone, find cover! This isn't a drill, this is war."

Before he finished speaking, the thick steel plate overhead suddenly let out a teeth-grinding tearing sound.

*Riiip—!*

A massive mechanical wolf claw glowing with red light pierced through the roof like cutting tofu, stabbing right next to where the mechanic had just been standing.

Extreme cold wind poured in through the breach, and the originally warm carriage instantly became an ice cellar.
