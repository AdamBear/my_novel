# Chapter 15: Treatment and Shopping

## Section 1: Asset Maintenance

The pure white transit station was so silent it made one's ears ring.

Su Liang curled up on the ground, her hands still tightly covering her ears. Blood had dried along her fingers, congealing into dark red scabs. Her face was deathly pale, her eyes vacant, clearly still immersed in the severe pain of ruptured eardrums and the lingering dizziness from the high-frequency noise.

Lin Yi stood before her, examining the settlement panel floating in mid-air.

[Second Instance: Lightless Hospital (Settlement Complete)]
[Basic Survival Points: 500 points]
[Boss Kill Bonus (Blind Doctor): 1000 points]
[Special Contribution (Hidden Floor Discovery): 300 points]
[Current Total Points: 2850 points]

"Two thousand eight hundred..."

Lin Yi narrowed his eyes. This was definitely a fortune at this stage. To put it in perspective, an ordinary tactical knife in the shop cost only 50 points, and a bottle of basic painkillers was just 10 points.

But he didn't rush to buy equipment for himself.

He turned around and looked at Su Liang suffering on the ground.

"Hey." Lin Yi kicked the tip of her shoe. "Can you hear me?"

Su Liang looked up blankly, watching Lin Yi's lips move, and sluggishly shook her head.

Hearing completely destroyed.

For an enhancer who relied on "auditory radar" to survive, she was now worse than useless.

"System, open the treatment list."

Lin Yi's fingers moved through the void.

[Intermediate Medical Pod: Complete repair of bodily injuries. Cost: 500 points.]
[High-Precision Cell Repair Fluid (Cochlear Specific): Targeted repair of damaged auditory nerves. Cost: 300 points.]

Lin Yi clicked the latter without hesitation.

A beam of green light descended from above, enveloping Su Liang's head.

"Mmm..." Su Liang let out a muffled groan, then her tightly furrowed brows gradually relaxed. The green light seemed to have a life of its own as it burrowed into her ear canal, repairing the ruptured eardrums and damaged nerves.

Five minutes later, the light dissipated.

Su Liang slowly released her hands and tentatively snapped her fingernails.

*Ding.*

A crisp sound.

She took a deep breath, her eyes becoming sharp again. She stood up, looked at Lin Yi, her tone complex: "Three hundred points. You're quite generous."

"Don't misunderstand."

Lin Yi coldly interrupted her. "This isn't charity—it's asset maintenance. If your ears can't be fixed, you'll be a burden in the next instance, and I won't hesitate to discard you."

With that, he flicked his finger, and a glowing virtual contract floated in front of Su Liang.

"Sign it."

Su Liang scanned the content, her pupils contracting slightly.

[Debt Contract]
[Creditor: Sample 17 (Lin Yi)]
[Debtor: Sample 99 (Su Liang)]
[Loan Amount: 300 points]
[Interest: Increases by 50% after each instance (compound interest)]
[Repayment Method: Priority use of instance earnings for repayment; if unable to repay, must unconditionally execute three orders issued by the creditor (under the premise of not violating survival principles).]

"50% compound interest?" Su Liang laughed in anger. "Even loan sharks aren't as ruthless as you. Lin Yi, did you study finance or robbery?"

"I studied staying alive."

Lin Yi remained expressionless. "In that elevator, I didn't throw you down to feed the dogs—that life was a gift from me. Now helping you fix your ears costs me money again. Do you think your life isn't worth this price?"

Su Liang fell silent.

She stared at the contract for a full ten seconds, then raised her hand and pressed her fingerprint without hesitation.

"Deal."

She looked at Lin Yi, the corner of her mouth curving into a dangerous arc. "You're the creditor, you call the shots. But you'd better pray you stay stronger than me, otherwise... I'll collect this debt in another way."

"I'll be waiting." Lin Yi put away the contract and turned away without looking at her again.

## Section 2: Passive Radar

After dealing with the "asset" issue, Lin Yi began focusing on his own enhancement.

[Gene [Nirvana] Unlock Progress: 10%]
[Acquired Trait: Danger Sense (Basic)]

"System, explain this ability." Lin Yi asked the void.

The Observer's luminous shadow appeared.

"[Danger Sense] is a sixth sense that organisms evolve under long-term survival pressure."

The mechanical voice explained. "It doesn't require visual or auditory participation. When a creature harbors strong killing intent toward you, or when a lethal attack is about to occur 0.5 seconds before it happens, your central nervous system will generate an instinctive 'phantom pain' warning."

"Like being pricked by a needle?"

"More intense than that. You'll feel skin tingling, and can even vaguely sense the direction from which the killing intent originates."

Lin Yi nodded. This was indeed a god-tier ability.

Being ambushed in [Abandoned School], being chased by the blind doctor in [Lightless Hospital]—if he'd had this ability back then, his survival rate would have been much higher.

"But..." The Observer's tone shifted. "Remember, it has one fatal blind spot."

"What?"

"It senses killing intent."

The Observer's ghostly blue eyes seemed to flicker. "What if the opponent has no killing intent? What if they genuinely believe they're 'loving' you, or... what if that thing has no 'consciousness' at all, but is just a segment of code executing a program..."

"Then your radar will be completely silent."

Lin Yi frowned. Attacks without killing intent?

"Like traps?"

"No, more complex than traps." The Observer didn't elaborate further. "You'll understand. In this world, sometimes the most dangerous enemies often wear the kindest smiles."

## Section 3: Shadows Under Sunlight

"Rest period ended."

The system countdown reached zero.

"Loading third instance... Difficulty level: ★★★☆☆."

"Scene constructing... Environmental parameters adjusting... Pain sensation locked at 100%..."

The white space began to collapse.

That familiar sensation—like being thrown into a tumble dryer—struck again.

...

...

*Ding-dong—*

A crisp doorbell sound.

Followed by bird chirps and the sound of morning news broadcasting.

Lin Yi's eyes snapped open.

He expected to see another gloomy ruin or a slaughterhouse reeking of blood.

But what met his eyes was... a bright, warm, even somewhat retro-styled apartment living room.

Sunlight filtered through white gauze curtains onto the floral carpet, the air filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread and a faint scent of lavender. On the branches outside the window, several sparrows hopped about cheerfully.

The wall clock pointed to eight o'clock in the morning.

The television was broadcasting a weather forecast: "Today's wonderful weather, perfect for airing out your mood..."

"Where is this?"

Su Liang had also awakened. She stood behind Lin Yi, warily surveying the surroundings. Her bloodstained clothes were gone, replaced by a clean set of home wear. Lin Yi was the same.

"This is the three-star instance?" Su Liang found it hard to believe. "It looks like my grandmother's living room."

Too normal.

So normal it was chilling.

Lin Yi walked to the window and looked outside.

This was a square-shaped old apartment building structure. In the middle was a beautiful courtyard garden, where several elderly people were practicing tai chi, and a few children were swinging on swings.

Neighborly harmony, years of tranquility.

But was this really reality?

Lin Yi subconsciously touched his face, then looked at himself in the nearby mirror.

He wasn't sure if it was an illusion, but he felt that the "Lin Yi" in the mirror had eyes that seemed even more... vivid than his own?

Just then, light footsteps came from outside the door.

*Knock knock knock.*

Someone was knocking.

"Hello there! New neighbors!"

An enthusiastic middle-aged woman's voice came from outside the door. "I'm Auntie Wang from across the hall, bringing you some cookies I baked myself! Open the door!"

Lin Yi and Su Liang exchanged glances.

Lin Yi closed his eyes, trying to activate his newly acquired [Danger Sense].

Complete silence.

No tingling, no warning. The "Auntie Wang" outside the door seemed to really be just a well-meaning neighbor.

But Lin Yi's hand quietly reached for the fruit knife on the table.

"Su Liang."

Lin Yi lowered his voice. "Listen to her heartbeat."

Su Liang pressed against the door. After a few seconds, her face became somewhat pale.

"What's wrong?"

"Her heartbeat..." Su Liang looked at Lin Yi, her voice trembling slightly. "It's too standard."

"What do you mean?"

"60 beats per minute. No more, no less. And the interval between each beat is precise to the millisecond." Su Liang swallowed. "A living person's heartbeat has noise and fluctuations. But that thing outside the door... is like a metronome wound up with a spring."
