# Volume Two: Out of Control

# Chapter 36: Bad Debt

## Section 1: Blue Screen

Falling.
Endless falling.

The howling wind in his ears gradually became sharp electronic static, like countless radios simultaneously tuned to channels with no signal. Lin Yi tightly gripped Su Liang's hand, staring fixedly at everything before him in the weightless sensation.

According to past experience, when a dungeon ended, that gentle white light would tenderly envelop survivors, bringing them back to that absolutely safe, absolutely clean transit station.

But this time, there was no white light.

Only madly flickering color blocks, distorted geometric shapes, and green garbled code cascading down like a waterfall. The entire world seemed to have become a shattered LCD screen, experiencing a violent logical collapse.

"Lin Yi! Something's wrong!"

Su Liang's voice was intermittent in the static. Her body was becoming translucent, like a poorly connected holographic projection. "My hand... is disappearing!"

"Hold tight!"

Lin Yi suddenly exerted force, trying to pull her in. But he discovered in horror that his fingers passed through Su Liang's wrist, as if grasping at air.

Physical rules had failed.

【System error... reconnection attempt... failed.】
【Severe logic contamination detected... source: Sample No. 17.】
【Initiating isolation program...】

That line of system notification jumping on his retina was no longer the familiar light blue, but had become a heart-palpitating dark red. The font edges were jagged, as if bleeding.

## Section 2: Cannot Settle

Then, that translucent settlement panel appeared out of nowhere, spanning before Lin Yi.

But it didn't show the anticipated point numbers, nor those phrases praising courage and wisdom.

【Fifth Dungeon: Perfect City (Crashed)】

【Basic Mission: Failed (Data lost)】
【Special Kill: Failed (Logic error)】
【Current Points: ERROR】

All values were jumping madly, instantly changing from "9999" to "-infinity."

Finally, all the garbled code converged into a pitch-black popup like a verdict:

**【Warning: Sample No. 17 has been marked as "Bad Debt."】**
**【Definition: Irreparable malfunctioning individual. Highly contagious. Refuses recycling.】**
**【Processing Recommendation: Physical destruction.】**

"Bad debt?"

Lin Yi looked at those two words. Though his body was in extreme chaos, he couldn't help but laugh.

That was the victor's laughter.

"Looks like that 'Father' died thoroughly..."

Lin Yi mocked the void. "You lofty Observers finally can't balance the books either?"

*Bzzt—*

That Observer who always carried divine radiance didn't appear.

Instead, a voice filled with electrical interference, even carrying a hint of exasperation:

"You... crossed the line..."
"This... doesn't comply with... the agreement..."

That was the Observer's voice, but now it sounded like a dying person with a shattered vocal cord.

## Section 3: Black Chains

"Agreement?"

The madness in Lin Yi's eyes intensified. "From the moment I stabbed that fragment into the mainframe, the agreement was voided."

Before he finished speaking, the surrounding chaotic data stream suddenly froze.

In the originally formless void, countless black fissures suddenly split open.

*Clatter—!*

Accompanied by teeth-grinding metal friction sounds, over a dozen pitch-black chains shot out from the fissures.

Those weren't physical metal, but "binding programs" constructed from the densest, darkest underlying code.

*Squelch! Squelch!*

The chains like conscious venomous snakes instantly pierced through Lin Yi's limbs.

No blood.

But a chill more terrifying than physical injury drilled into his soul through the wounds. Lin Yi felt his strength being rapidly drained. The [Polar Tactical Suit] he'd exchanged, the [P-19 Pistol] at his waist, even the [Pain Blocking] ability in his body—all were being forcibly stripped away.

【Warning: Permission banned.】
【Warning: Assets frozen.】
【Warning: Ability modules uninstalling...】

"Ah—!!!"

Su Liang not far away let out a scream. She was also entangled by chains, her whole body like a butterfly caught in a spider web, unable to move no matter how she struggled.

"Let her go!"

Lin Yi roared, trying to break free.

But the more he struggled, the tighter those black chains constricted, even deeply embedding into his flesh and bone, trying to format him.

## Section 4: Garbage Collection

"Sample No. 17, Sample No. 99."

That broken Observer voice sounded again, this time carrying no emotion, only the coldness of processing garbage.

"Given the irreversible damage you've caused to the system, you will be stripped of 'trial participant' qualification."

"You will be exiled to 'Sector Zero.'"

"There is no light there, no rules, and no exit."

"That is the graveyard where the system dumps 'bad debts' and 'dead files.'"

*RUMBLE—!*

The void beneath their feet suddenly collapsed, revealing a bottomless black vortex.

That vortex emanated a despairing suction—the final destination of deleted data.

"Exile?"

Lin Yi was dragged by chains, sliding bit by bit toward that abyss.

At the last moment before being swallowed, he not only didn't beg for mercy, but with his still-mobile left hand, tightly clenched his fist.

In his left palm, that [Fragment of Reality] brought out from the previous dungeon was heating up, glowing red due to the system's rejection reaction, deeply branding into his flesh and blood, growing together with his bones.

That was his only weapon.

Also proof of his absolute refusal to compromise.

"Listen..."

Lin Yi raised his middle finger to the void, his gaze darker than that abyss. "No matter where you throw me... hell or grave..."

"As long as I don't die, I will definitely crawl back."

"And slaughter you bastards... to the last one."

*Whoosh—!*

Darkness swallowed everything.

In the final field of vision, only the Observer's ghostly blue eyes flashed through the garbled code, seemingly carrying a trace of unprecedented... fear.
