# Chapter 23: Steel Torrent

## Section 1: The Scent of Metal

The mechanical claw that pierced through the roof didn't immediately retract. Instead, like opening a can, accompanied by teeth-grinding metal tearing sounds, it forcibly ripped open a half-meter-wide gash in the heavy armored steel plate. The minus fifty-degree gale instantly poured in mixed with ice crystals. The originally warm air condensed into white mist the moment it contacted the cold wind, and the carriage's temperature alarm began flashing red frantically.

"Scatter! Don't stand underneath!"

Lin Yi roared, the kinetic pistol in his hand almost instinctively rising as he squeezed the trigger twice at the breach. Bang! Bang! The electromagnetically accelerated bullets, trailing blue flames, precisely hit the claw's joint, splashing a string of dazzling sparks. But this mechanical monster had no pain receptors. It merely paused, then a metal wolf head with glowing crimson electronic eyes poked through the breach. It wasn't a creature, but a killing machine piled with cold gears, hydraulic rods, and sensors. Its electronic eyes rapidly scanned the carriage interior, emitting a buzzing lock-on sound, finally fixing on the mercenary closest to it.

"Fuck! What the hell is that!"

The mercenary's reaction wasn't slow either. He raised his assault rifle and unleashed a burst at the wolf head. Rat-tat-tat-tat! The bullets hitting the mechanical wolf's alloy armor made crisp clanging sounds. Most ricocheted off, only a few smashing its external sensors. But this didn't drive it back—instead, it triggered its counterattack program. The mechanical wolf opened its metal maw full of rotating saw teeth, and from deep in its throat came an extremely strange high-frequency screech.

## Section 2: Infrasonic Barrier

*Hummm—!*

That wasn't an ordinary sound, but an invisible infrasonic shockwave. In that instant, everyone in the carriage felt their brains hammered by a heavy blow. The mercenary closest to it directly knelt on the ground clutching his ears, two streams of blood flowing from his nostrils, his gun dropping to the floor. The doctor and mechanic curled into balls even more painfully, letting out pig-like screams. Though Su Liang was mentally prepared, the side effects of her enhanced hearing made her more vulnerable to this sonic attack. She grunted, her body swaying as she leaned against the container, face deathly pale.

Only Lin Yi stood in place, completely motionless. He felt the shockwave impact his consciousness, but deep in his brain, there seemed to be an invisible wall that forcibly blocked this neural system震荡 from outside.

【Mental attack detected... [Mental Barrier] automatically triggered.】

The system notification flashed through his mind. This was the value of the third dungeon's completion reward. Facing these mechanical monsters that only used physical attacks, Lin Yi with his mental resistance was the only clear-headed one. He didn't waste this one-second window. The moment the mechanical wolf prepared to jump down, he calmly adjusted his aim, targeting a glowing hydraulic tube beneath the armor gap at its neck.

Bang!

The third shot. The kinetic bullet precisely drilled into the gap, piercing the hydraulic tube. Black engine oil sprayed out like blood. The mechanical wolf's movements instantly stiffened, that massive claw limply drooping, its entire body stuck in the breach, unable to move.

## Section 3: The Cost of Heat

"It's not over! Push it out!"

Lin Yi rushed over and kicked the still-dazed mercenary in the rear. "Stop playing dead! Want to become an ice sculpture?"

The carriage temperature was plummeting. That breach was like a giant exhaust fan, frantically sucking away all the heat. The pointer on the mechanic's old-fashioned thermometer was already racing below zero. If no one plugged that hole or repaired it, even if they killed all the monsters, they'd freeze to death within ten minutes.

The mercenary snapped back to reality. Looking at the stuck mechanical wolf overhead, a vicious gleam flashed in his eyes. He and the other veteran together roared and raised their rifle butts, madly smashing at the mechanical wolf's head, forcibly hammering the several-hundred-pound wreckage down from the roof.

"Mechanic! Patch the hole!" Lin Yi shouted back.

The short mechanic tremblingly crawled out from cover, holding a spare steel plate and welding torch, but his hands shook so badly he couldn't hold the tools steady. "Too... too cold..." His teeth chattered, his eyebrows already frosted over.

"If you don't want to die, weld it shut!" Lin Yi slapped his gun on the container, that cold oppressive presence more chilling than the blizzard outside. The mechanic was startled into action. Survival instinct unleashed amazing potential. He climbed up on the box, braving the pouring cold wind, and began frantically welding the steel plate.

## Section 4: First Blood

Just when everyone thought the crisis was temporarily resolved, the connection door at the carriage rear suddenly made a soft sound. Not the sound of violent breaking, but of some highly corrosive liquid quietly melting the lock core.

"Watch the rear!" Su Liang's voice was weak but still sharp.

But it was a step too late. The veteran who had been guarding the rear—the team's other meat shield—suddenly felt the ground give way beneath his feet. The floor had been corroded through at some point. A miniature mechanical scorpion lurking beneath the carriage, its tail stinger glowing blue, had already silently pierced through his ankle.

"Ahhh—!"

The veteran screamed, but he didn't immediately counterattack. Instead, his whole body suddenly froze. It wasn't poison—it was rapid-freeze liquid. A layer of eerie white frost instantly spread up from his ankle, sealing his entire lower leg in the blink of an eye. His muscles, blood vessels, and bones became fragile ice sculptures in that instant.

The mechanical scorpion yanked hard.

*Crack.*

A bone-chilling brittle sound. The veteran's lower leg snapped like a withered branch. No blood flowed from the break—only pink ice shards and pale bone fragments. He hadn't even felt the pain yet when he lost balance and crashed heavily to the ground. Then more mechanical scorpions poured in through the corroded hole, waving red-hot pincers, lunging at the incapacitated casualty.

"Save me! Save me!" The veteran desperately reached toward Lin Yi.

Lin Yi glanced at the swarm of scorpions, then at the mechanic desperately welding the roof. If they didn't hold the roof, everyone would freeze to death. If they didn't deal with these scorpions, the defense line would collapse from within.

"Su Liang, incendiary!"

Lin Yi didn't go to pull the veteran, but calmly issued the order. His gun muzzle swiveled, continuously firing at the floor hole, blocking the scorpions' reinforcements. Su Liang, enduring the ringing in her ears, pulled an incendiary grenade from her waist, yanked the pin, and without even looking at the still-screaming teammate, threw it directly into the densest part of the scorpion swarm.

*BOOM!*

Flames exploded at the carriage rear. The high temperature instantly consumed those mechanical scorpions, and also consumed the veteran's final wails.

The air filled with a mixed smell of roasted meat and burnt circuit boards.

Lin Yi expressionlessly loaded a new magazine.

"This is war." He said coldly. "Dead people have no value. Only the living deserve to talk about the future."
