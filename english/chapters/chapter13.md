# **Chapter 13: The Elevator Paradox**

## **Section 1: The Devil's Math Problem**

The teeth-grinding high-frequency scraping sound in the corridor finally stopped.

Su Liang curled up on the ground, hands still tightly covering her bleeding ears, body occasionally twitching from the aftershocks of severe pain. That sharp scalpel lay beside her, like an abandoned toy.

Lin Yi stood in the elevator, looking down at her.

His finger hovered over the red **[Close Door]** button. Just press it, and this elevator would carry the only survivor away from hell, while Su Liang would become the last piece of meat to feed those approaching monsters.

This was the optimal solution to the standard prisoner's dilemma.

**[Warning: Structure severely damaged]**
**[Maximum safe load: 70kg]**
**[Current load: 68kg]**

That bright red electronic screen flashed frantically, as if urging Lin Yi to make a decision quickly.

"Goodbye..." Su Liang raised her blood-stained face, eyes venomous and desperate, her lips moving, emitting a weak sound.

Lin Yi didn't move.

His gaze passed over Su Liang, landing on the cable connection at the top of the elevator car.

Those were three steel wire ropes with 20mm diameter. Though one was broken, though the surface was covered in rust, as a science student, Lin Yi's brain in an extremely calm state instantly completed a force analysis.

20mm steel wire rope, single rope breaking tension at least 20 tons. Even with 90% loss from rust and aging, the remaining two could still bear at least 4 tons of weight.

And this car plus two people, at most 200 kilograms.

"70 kilogram weight limit?"

Lin Yi's lips curved into a mocking cold smile. "System, are you insulting my intelligence?"

This wasn't a physics problem at all. This was a psychology problem.

The system was betting. Betting on human selfishness in desperate situations, betting that the instinct to survive at any cost would override reason. If Lin Yi really believed this sign and pressed the close button, he wouldn't just be killing a teammate—he'd be losing this game about "the upper limit of humanity."

"Get up."

Lin Yi suddenly released the button and kicked Su Liang's calf.

"Stop playing dead. This elevator can hold an elephant."

Su Liang froze. Through her blood-smeared vision, she looked at Lin Yi in disbelief.

"You... won't kill me?"

"I did think about killing you." Lin Yi's voice was as cold as discussing the weather. "Your points are tempting. But compared to points, in this trial full of lunatics and monsters, a radar that can hear heartbeats through walls is more valuable."

He bent down, his intact right hand gripping Su Liang's collar like an iron clamp, not caring if it hurt, dragging her like a dead dog into the elevator.

"You are my asset."

Lin Yi threw Su Liang into the corner, then heavily slapped the close button. "Before the asset depreciates, I won't allow you to die at someone else's hands."

*Click.*

The gate closed.

In that instant, over a dozen semi-transparent shadowless ghost nurses rushed from the darkness. They frantically crashed against the iron bars, letting out unwilling shrieks.

But the elevator shook once, carrying the two people, steadily ascending.

No alarm. No falling.

Only that originally bright red **[Overload Warning]** on the electronic screen, after flickering twice, turned into a line of green mocking text:

**[Congratulations: Even in darkness, reason remains humanity's sharpest weapon.]**

## **Section 2: Specimens in Jars**

The elevator rose steadily in the shaft.

In the narrow car, two blood-soaked people faced each other in silence.

Su Liang leaned in the corner, using her sleeve to wipe the blood from her ear canal. She looked at Lin Yi's expressionless profile and suddenly laughed softly.

That laugh changed from hoarse to shrill, carrying a kind of post-survival madness.

"Lunatics... we're all lunatics..."

"Likewise." Lin Yi didn't turn around, his gaze through the gate gaps, watching the shaft outside.

The elevator passed through the mezzanine between B1 and floor 1.

That was a space not marked on the map. The light was dim, with only countless huge glass cylinders emitting ghostly green fluorescence.

"That's..." Su Liang stopped laughing, pupils contracting.

Those were culture vessels.

Hundreds and thousands of huge jars, soaking various deformed creatures.

Lin Yi saw embryos with huge ears and sewn eye sockets—miniature versions of the blind eye doctor. Saw female bodies with elongated limbs and transparent skin—prototypes of shadowless ghost nurses.

But what made their spines chill most wasn't the monsters.

It was on a broken jar near the elevator shaft, a remaining metal nameplate:

**[Experimental Subject: Sample-004]**
**[Source: Third Trial Failure]**
**[Cause of Death: Mental Value Zero (Gene Collapse)]**
**[Recovery Purpose: Biological Weapon Modification]**

That jar floated half a severed limb, still wearing the same blue-and-white striped hospital gown as Lin Yi wore.

Deathly silence enveloped the elevator.

"Those monsters..." Su Liang's voice trembled, she instinctively grabbed Lin Yi's pant leg. "They... were once players?"

"Failed players."

Lin Yi stared at that number, eyes terrifyingly cold. "Mental value zero isn't simple death. It's becoming this kind of thing."

So the so-called "erasure" wasn't disappearance.

But being recycled by the system, stripped of humanity, transformed into the next trial's level Boss, to hunt new batches of survivors.

This was a perfect, man-eating closed loop.

"This is the price." Lin Yi turned around, looking at Su Liang. "Now you know why I won't let you die? If we don't want to become that kind of rotten meat soaking in formalin, we have to keep winning."

"Even if it means selling our souls to the devil."

Su Liang took a deep breath. She supported herself on the railing and slowly stood up. That last bit of weakness in her cool eyes disappeared. She extended her blood-stained hand.

"Deal. Partner."

Lin Yi glanced at her hand and didn't shake it, only coldly nodding.

## **Section 3: Greenhouse Above the Ruins**

*Ding—*

The elevator finally stopped.

The iron door on the top floor slowly opened.

Long-awaited wind rushed in. But it wasn't fresh wind—it was a dry wind mixed with sand and burnt smell.

Lin Yi and Su Liang walked out of the elevator.

They thought they'd see the hospital rooftop, or return to that pure white transfer station.

But the scene before them completely shattered their understanding.

They stood on a huge metal platform.

Above their heads was a sky-covering semi-transparent dome. Through the dome's gray glass, they could see outside was a dim yellow sky.

No sun. Only endless yellow sand raging.

On the distant horizon, they could vaguely see ruins of cities that once belonged to human civilization—those tilted skyscrapers standing in the sand sea like tombstones. Several mountain-sized mechanical beasts (or some kind of silicon-based creatures) were slowly moving through the ruins, emitting earth-shaking roars.

And beneath their feet, this so-called "Lightless Hospital" was merely one of countless "culture boxes" inside this huge dome.

On the dome's inner wall, written in red paint was a line of mottled giant slogan, each character like it was painted with blood:

**[For humanity's continuation, welcome to hell.]**

"This is... Earth?"

Lin Yi walked to the platform edge, looking at that dead world outside, feeling all the blood in his body freeze.

"That's the world fifty years from now."

The Observer's voice suddenly rang in the air. This time, no longer cold mechanical sound, but carrying a hint of barely concealed exhaustion and sighing.

"Looks like you've discovered the truth. This isn't just a trial ground."

"This is a greenhouse."

"We built these sealed ecological boxes on the ruins, simulating various disasters from the old era, to screen genes that can adapt to that hell outside."

The Observer's voice paused, tone becoming unusually serious:

"Congratulations, Sample 17, Sample 99."

"You've proven you're not waste to be recycled. You are seeds."

White light began gathering on the two people. That was the precursor to teleportation.

"Wait!" Lin Yi suddenly shouted. "What happened outside? What are those giant beasts?"

"That's the next stage curriculum."

The Observer didn't answer.

"Survive. Until you're qualified to push open this dome's door."

White light swallowed everything.

Only that blood-red slogan remained, appearing especially glaring against the backdrop of endless yellow sand.
