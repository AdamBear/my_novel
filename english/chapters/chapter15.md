# Chapter 15: Perfect Community

## Section 1: Semi-Permanent Smile

"Coming! Auntie Wang!"

In that instant, Lin Yi channeled his inner actor. The coldness and vigilance on his face vanished instantly, replaced by a slightly shy, polite smile fitting for a "newly moved-in college student" persona.

He gave Su Liang a meaningful look, signaling her to put away the surgical knife and hide it behind her back.

*Click.*

The door opened.

Standing at the doorway was a middle-aged woman wearing a floral apron with a plump figure. She held a plate of freshly baked cookies, their aroma enticing.

But Lin Yi's first reaction wasn't hunger—it was dissonance.

Too perfect.

Her hair was meticulously styled, each strand's curl seemingly calculated with precision. Her skin was smooth like a wax figure, not even a visible pore. Most importantly, her smile.

It was an extremely standard smile, revealing exactly eight teeth. The angle of her upturned lips, the arc of her eye corners—it was like they'd been painted on, rigidly hung on her face.

"Oh my, you must be the newlywed couple who just moved in?"

Auntie Wang's voice was enthusiastically high-pitched, with an exaggeratedly intimate tone. "You're so handsome! I'm the building group leader, everyone calls me Auntie Wang. These are cookies I baked myself, try them!"

"Thank you, Auntie Wang, you're too kind."

Lin Yi accepted the plate with both hands, appearing flattered. "We just arrived, we'll need to rely on your guidance going forward."

"No trouble at all! In Apartment 404, what we value most is neighborly harmony."

Auntie Wang's eyeballs rotated in their sockets, her gaze passing over Lin Yi's shoulder and landing on Su Liang inside the room.

In that instant, Lin Yi felt her smile seemed to... crack a little.

"Oh dear, why does this young lady look so pale?" Auntie Wang leaned her head in with concern. "Are you feeling unwell? Should Auntie make you some brown sugar water?"

Su Liang stood in the shadows, her spine straight, because she heard that sound.

*Tap, tap, tap, tap.*

As Auntie Wang spoke, her heartbeat maintained an absolutely uniform pace of one beat per second, without even half a beat of fluctuation.

"Thank you, Auntie, I just get a bit carsick." Su Liang forced out a smile.

"Oh, that's good, that's good."

Auntie Wang withdrew her gaze and looked at Lin Yi again. "Well, I won't disturb your rest then. By the way, there's a 'Resident Rules' booklet on the table, remember to read it! In our place, only those who are polite and follow the rules can live long-term."

When saying the words "long-term," she deliberately emphasized them, her eyes—black as glass beads—staring fixedly at Lin Yi as if trying to see through his retinas.

"Yes, definitely will." Lin Yi nodded obsequiously.

"See you then!"

Auntie Wang waved her hand and turned to leave.

Until she walked to the opposite door and took out her key to open it, that turning movement was as smooth as a preset program.

*Bang.*

The opposite door closed.

The smile on Lin Yi's face vanished instantly. He quickly closed the door, locked it, then dumped the plate of aromatic cookies directly into the trash bin.

"Don't touch that thing." Lin Yi said coldly. "Who knows what it's made of."

"I'm not hungry." Su Liang's face was pale. "That woman... when she walked, the force of her heels hitting the ground was completely consistent. Is she a robot?"

"If she were a robot, that would actually be better."

Lin Yi walked to the dining table and picked up the red envelope. "If it's a program, at least there's logic. I'm afraid it's something worse."

## Section 2: Red Rules

The envelope was printed with embossed golden characters: [Apartment 404 Resident Rules].

Lin Yi pulled out the letter paper inside. The paper was yellowed, emitting a faint musty smell, completely incongruous with this bright and warm room.

The words were handwritten in red ink, the handwriting somewhat scrawled, exuding an aura of madness.

[Dear Resident, welcome to Model Apartment 404.]

[To maintain our community's "perfectly harmonious" atmosphere, please be sure to follow these rules. Those who violate the rules will be considered "unqualified neighbors" and will be cleaned up by property management.]

[1. This apartment values neighborly harmony, quarreling and loud noise are prohibited. If you hear screaming or cries for help from next door, it's just the sound of a TV program. Please do not knock on the door to disturb them, and definitely do not call the police.]

[2. Daily activity hours are from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. After 8:00 PM, please draw the curtains and remain quiet. If you see a face pressed against the glass outside the window, please ignore it and do not make eye contact.]

[3. Please remain polite. When neighbors greet you, you must respond. Refusing a neighbor's goodwill (such as gifted food) is impolite behavior, but you may choose to accept it and not eat it.]

[4. There are no mirrors in the apartment. If you discover a mirror in your room, please immediately cover it with cloth and do not gaze into the mirror for more than 10 seconds. Even if the person in the mirror is smiling at you.]

[5. The hallway has 12 steps. If you count a 13th step, immediately close your eyes, stand still, and don't move until you hear a cat meowing.]

[6. Do not attempt to leave through the apartment's main entrance. Construction is underway outside, it's very dangerous.]

[7. Please remember your family members' faces. If you discover your family member looks "exceptionally perfect" today, or they mention secrets that only you should know... please immediately kill them.]

(This rule's handwriting was very scrawled, as if someone had hastily added it later, followed by a blood-red exclamation mark.)

After reading the rules, the room fell into deathly silence.

"Rule seven..." Su Liang looked at Lin Yi, subconsciously touching the surgical knife hidden in her sleeve.

"Don't be nervous."

Lin Yi folded the rules and put them in his pocket. "This is a typical rules horror scenario. The rules are half true and half false. If rule seven is real, it means things here can mimic."

"Mimic?"

"Imitate our appearance, access our memories, even... replace us."

Lin Yi walked to the window, looking through the gap in the gauze curtains at the courtyard below.

"Also, both our [Danger Sense] and [Auditory Radar] are limited here. This means the monsters don't act on killing intent—they might think they are 'human.'"

"Then how do we distinguish them?" Su Liang asked.

"Look for flaws." Lin Yi pointed to his head. "Logic, emotion, and that uniquely human... imperfection."

"Let's go, take a walk outside. The system matched 6 players, we need to see if the others are also this 'perfect.'"

## Section 3: Imperfect Intruders

The two walked out of their room and came to the sunny courtyard garden.

This place was practically a retirement cadre's paradise.

Several elderly men wearing white practice uniforms were doing tai chi, their movements uniformly synchronized, slow as a slow-motion replay. A few children were building castles in the sandbox, not noisy or rowdy, well-behaved like porcelain dolls.

This "years of tranquility" was full of flaws to Lin Yi's eyes.

Too quiet.

No children screaming, no elderly people coughing, even the sound of wind rustling through leaves seemed like background sound effects.

"Hey! What the hell kind of place is this?!"

A crude roar shattered the silence.

On the other side of the courtyard, a buzz-cut, tattoo-covered muscular man was shouting at an elderly man practicing tai chi.

"I'm asking you a question! Where's the exit? Why won't that damn iron gate open?"

That was Sample 33, seemingly a hot-tempered veteran, clearly lacking patience for this puzzle-type instance.

The elderly man whose practice was interrupted stopped his movements.

Not just him.

Throughout the entire courtyard, all the elderly practicing tai chi, all the children playing in the sand, even the gardener trimming flowers and grass...

In the same second, they all stopped moving.

Like machines whose power had been cut, they stiffly turned their necks, dozens of eyes uniformly looking toward the tattooed man.

No anger, no surprise.

Only that standard, hollow, semi-permanent smile.

"This..." The tattooed man was startled by this eerie scene and took half a step back. "What are you looking at? Believe it or not, I'll beat you?"

"Young man, one must be polite."

The elderly man still maintained the "White Crane Spreads Wings" posture, his lips unmoved, but his voice clearly transmitted. "Disrupting harmony is unwelcome."

"Screw your harmony!"

The tattooed man also had a violent temper, or perhaps he wanted to use violence to test the NPCs' limits. He violently shoved the elderly man.

The elderly man didn't budge.

Instead, the tattooed man felt like he'd pushed against a cement pillar, the shock numbing his wrist.

"Sample 33... he's courting death." Lin Yi stood under a distant tree shade, coldly watching this scene. "He's violating rule one: no quarreling."

"Should we help him?" Su Liang asked.

"No."

Lin Yi put his hands in his pockets, his gaze indifferent. "We need a sample. Let's see what the consequences of violating rules are."

No bloody massacre occurred.

The elderly man just gave the tattooed man a deep look, then his smile grew even wider, so wide his mouth corners nearly split to his ears.

"It seems you need to go to the correction room to learn some manners."

After speaking, all the NPCs simultaneously withdrew their gazes and continued their previous actions. The tai chi continued, the children continued building sand castles, as if nothing had just happened.

This collective disregard was more chilling than a direct attack.

The tattooed man cursed and walked away, seemingly thinking these NPCs weren't particularly impressive.

But he didn't notice that when he turned around, in his shadow, something that didn't belong to him seemed to appear.

"He's finished."

Lin Yi withdrew his gaze. "Tonight, he'll be 'replaced.'"

"How do you know?"

"Because of how that elderly man looked at him just now." Lin Yi said in a low voice. "That wasn't the look you give an enemy. That was the look you give a spare part."
