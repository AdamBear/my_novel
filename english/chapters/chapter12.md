# **Chapter 12: Self-Dissection**

## **Section 1: Blood Beacon**

*Drip. Drip.*

Blood slid down Lin Yi's fingertips, smashing onto the white tiles. The sound was infinitely amplified in the deathly silent operating room, like a death knell being struck.

That blind eye doctor didn't rush to pounce.

It was like a cat toying with a mouse, slightly tilting its head, that pair of deformed huge ears gently trembling with the rhythm of the blood drops. It was enjoying, enjoying the sweet scent emitted by prey from blood loss and fear.

The bone saw in its hand still rotated at low speed, emitting a *buzz buzz* standby sound, like a hungry beast growling.

"Damn it..."

Lin Yi curled up under the sink in the operating prep room, face pale as paper.

The severe pain in his left arm made his whole body spasm. Though that saw cut earlier hadn't broken bone, it directly tore off a large chunk of skin and flesh from the outside of his upper arm. Red muscle fibers were exposed to the air, blood gushing out like an unstoppable faucet.

This wasn't just an injury.

In this instance relying on "hearing" and "smell," this wound was a signal tower broadcasting at high power.

As long as blood kept flowing, as long as that bloody smell kept spreading, wherever he went, that blind doctor could follow.

"Can't hide..."

Lin Yi looked at that huge shadow slowly approaching not far away.

Su Liang had long since disappeared somewhere. That woman would definitely watch him die from the side, then use the time he was being eaten to steal the generator.

This was reality.

Lin Yi's eyes gradually changed from panic to murky, then in extreme pain condensed into a kind of mad clarity.

He fumbled on the instrument tray beside the sink.

Hemostatic clamps... gauze... none. Only a surgical scalpel used to remove necrotic tissue, sharp beyond measure.

"No other choice."

Lin Yi looked at that chunk of dangling, constantly dripping rotten flesh on his left arm. That was the biggest source of the smell. If he didn't deal with it, if he didn't stop the bleeding, he would surely die.

But he had no tourniquet, and no time to bandage.

That doctor had already reached the prep room door, the bone saw's rotation speed beginning to increase.

Lin Yi made a decision that violated biological instinct.

He used his intact right hand to firmly grip that surgical scalpel.

## **Section 2: Pain's Threshold**

"If I don't treat myself as human..." Lin Yi gritted his teeth, cheeks bulging, gums seeping blood. "Then there's nothing to fear."

He pressed that chunk of rotten flesh hanging from his arm, connected by skin, onto the edge of the cold stainless steel sink.

No anesthesia.

No hesitation.

Not even time for a deep breath.

Lin Yi's right hand suddenly exerted force, the scalpel cutting into his own skin like cutting butter.

*Riiip—*

That was the sound of metal slicing through fascia.

"Mmph!!!"

A scream forcibly suppressed in his throat. Lin Yi's pupils dilated to the extreme in that instant, the whites of his eyes filled with burst blood vessels.

Pain.

Indescribable pain.

If previous injuries were passive endurance, then this current "self-mutilation" was actively embracing hell. With each cut, nerve endings sent the highest level red alerts to his brain.

Sweat instantly soaked his entire body, like he'd just been pulled from water.

But he didn't stop.

In that moment, Lin Yi seemed to detach himself. He watched from an almost cold third-person perspective as that flesh called "Lin Yi" cut itself.

Second cut. Severed the adhering muscle.

Third cut. Peeled away the still-bleeding skin layer.

*Plop.*

A palm-sized, blood-drenched chunk of flesh fell into the sink.

Lin Yi nearly passed out from pain, his vision full of stars. But with his last shred of rationality, he grabbed the alcohol bottle beside him and poured it directly onto that fresh cut surface.

*Sizzle—!*

Alcohol contacted raw flesh, white smoke rising.

This pain sufficient to cause shock finally became the last straw that broke the camel's back.

No, not broke.

Detonated.

## **Section 3: Nirvana**

Just as Lin Yi's consciousness was about to black out, that long-absent burning sensation erupted again from deep in his spine.

**[Warning: Pain signal overflow.]**
**[Warning: Mental threshold critical.]**
**[Detecting host in extreme survival state... Gene lock... forced activation.]**

*Hum—*

The world went quiet.

That heart-wrenching pain suddenly became distant, as if separated by a thick layer of glass.

Time slowed down.

Lin Yi could clearly see the dust floating in the air, each particle slowly rotating.

He raised his head, looking toward the blind eye doctor at the door.

That originally flawless monster, at this moment in his eyes—or rather, in his forcibly evolved auditory world—was no longer mysterious.

He "heard" it.

He heard the squeezing sound of bones inside the doctor's body, heard the taut sound of tendons stretching, even heard the faint noise of the rotor rubbing carbon brushes inside the bone saw motor.

Countless sounds converged into a three-dimensional structural diagram.

No need for eyes.

Sound outlined the direction of muscles, outlined its next move.

Left leg muscle contraction... center of gravity shifting forward... bone saw tilting 30 degrees right...

It was going to sweep horizontally.

0.5 seconds before the blind eye doctor raised its hand, Lin Yi's brain had already predicted its attack trajectory.

"So... this is how you move."

Lin Yi's lips curved into a blood-stained fierce smile.

## **Section 4: Mad Dog's Bait**

*Whoosh!*

The bone saw swept past with a shrill wind sound, directly cutting the stainless steel sink countertop in half.

Sparks flew.

But there was no one there.

Lin Yi, the moment it attacked, slid out along the ground like a boneless mollusk.

He was dancing face-to-face with death.

"Roar?"

The blind eye doctor seemed confused. It smelled even stronger bloody scent, but its prey had disappeared.

Just then.

*Smack!*

A blood-drenched chunk of flesh—the piece Lin Yi had just cut from himself—was thrown hard toward the high-voltage distribution box in the corner of the operating room.

The flesh chunk hit the iron box, making a dull sound and leaving large amounts of blood traces.

That was the "perfect bait" Lin Yi created.

That location was full of Lin Yi's strongest scent, emitted the loudest sound.

The blind eye doctor was instantly attracted by this strong signal.

It charged toward that blood-stained iron box without thinking, letting out an excited roar, raising the bone saw, launching a fatal charge.

It mistook that bloody iron box for Lin Yi.

"Goodbye."

Lin Yi, hiding under the operating table, coldly uttered two words.

*BOOM!!!*

The high-speed rotating metal saw blade cut through the distribution box's outer shell, directly severing the high-voltage bus bars inside.

Blue electric arcs instantly erupted, like wildly dancing lightning snakes, following the conductive metal saw blade, directly drilling into the blind eye doctor's body.

*Bzzzzzzt—!!!*

The blind eye doctor let out an inhuman scream. Its body convulsed violently under the strong current, that green surgical gown instantly charred black, the air filling with a nauseating burnt smell.

Though it was a monster, it was still a carbon-based organism.

Before high-voltage electricity, all beings are equal.

Over ten seconds later.

With a *bang*, the distribution box exploded. The blind eye doctor fell straight down like a charred log, the bone saw in its hand finally stopping its rotation.

The operating room returned to deathly silence.

Only Lin Yi's heavy breathing.

He slowly crawled out from under the bed. His right hand covered his left arm wound already bound tight with rags, his whole person like an evil spirit just crawled from a blood pool.

He didn't even glance at the Boss on the ground.

He only raised his head, looking toward the dark depths, his eyes showing an unprecedented coldness and danger.

That was a gaze only those who had truly died would have.

"Come out."

Lin Yi said to the seemingly empty corner, voice hoarse. "I know you're there, Su Liang."
