# Chapter 19: Irrational Game Theory

## Section 1: The Exclusivity of Usury

The white mist on the rooftop remained thick, like a heavy shroud separating the two from the surrounding world. The air was filled with that strange burnt smell—the odor left behind after the fake person had been "deleted."

The mirror shard in Lin Yi's hand was covered with black viscous liquid, its tip pointed directly at the throat of the newly appeared Su Liang. His muscles were tense; if the other party showed even one wrong micro-expression, he would stab down without hesitation.

"Answer me."

Lin Yi's voice was cold as ice, devoid of any emotional fluctuation. "About that debt—how much do I owe you?"

The Su Liang across from him stopped in her tracks.

She first cast an extremely disgusted glance at the pool of black water on the ground, then her gaze moved up to Lin Yi's still-bleeding right arm. Her brow furrowed, not out of concern, but from the annoyance of having some calculation disrupted.

"Three hundred principal."

She spoke coldly, her speech rapid, as if reciting a contract she had long memorized. "The 'asset repair fee' you used at the transit station. According to the contract, compound interest increases by 50% after each dungeon. We're now at the beginning of the third dungeon. Although it hasn't been settled yet, the interest has already started accumulating."

She paused, a shrewd cold light flashing in her eyes—the kind of look that made Lin Yi feel extremely familiar. It was the gaze of a capitalist examining a non-performing asset.

"Add in the killing intent you just had toward me, plus the investment risk caused by your half-dead state... the current total with principal and interest is 450 points. Lin Yi, if you dare die here, I'll immediately take your inheritance to fill this hole."

Hearing these words, Lin Yi's tense shoulders finally relaxed.

It was a sense of security that could only be experienced in this hell—security built on absolute self-interest.

He threw away the mirror shard in his hand and let out a long breath, leaning against the cold ventilation duct.

"Correct answer."

"You're real."

Su Liang stepped forward and roughly grabbed Lin Yi's injured right arm. She didn't use any gentle tone, but directly tore off the bandage that the fake person hadn't finished tying, forcefully tightening it to stop the bleeding.

"Hiss—" Lin Yi sucked in a sharp breath from the pain.

"Bear with it." Su Liang snorted coldly. "What did that impostor say? To make you go to such extremes?"

"It said it would write off the debt."

Lin Yi looked at Su Liang's cold face, the corner of his mouth curling into a mocking smile. "It said that compared to money, a teammate's life is more important. It was too gentle, too... perfect."

Su Liang's fingers paused for a moment, then she let out a scoff.

"Perfect idiot." She commented, forcefully tying a knot. "In this hellhole, if it weren't for that IOU, I would have thrown you down the moment you got injured. Greed is the strongest chain between us."

This was the fatal bug of the fake people.

They possessed the target's memories and could even share data through the mirror network. So they knew about the debt's existence. But their underlying logic was "harmony" and "perfection." In their algorithm, eliminating debt and mutual assistance was the "optimal solution" for human society.

They couldn't understand the irrational greed and extreme distrust of others buried deep in human nature.

It was precisely this ugly aspect of humanity that saved Lin Yi's life.

## Section 2: Gathering in the Uncanny Valley

"We can't stay here."

After confirming identities, Su Liang immediately entered combat mode. She pressed her ear to the wind, her expression turning grim. "Those neighbors are coming up. Not just the stairs—I hear wall-climbing sounds... many of them."

"How many?"

"Dozens. And..." Su Liang's pupils contracted slightly. "All heartbeats are at the standard frequency of 60 beats per minute. As uniform as a military parade."

Before she finished speaking, heavy impact sounds came from the iron door leading to the rooftop.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*

The sound was no longer chaotic pounding, but had a certain eerie rhythm. Each impact was like a hammer striking the heart.

"They're learning." Lin Yi glanced at the shaking iron door—the last line of defense. "That fake person just tried to deceive me with 'warmth' and failed. Now they might switch strategies."

"Kill us all?" Su Liang gripped her dagger tightly.

"No, if it were killing, it would actually be simpler."

Lin Yi stared at the door, his expression grim. "It's 'correction.' In their logic, we're malfunctioning parts. They want to turn us into those perfect beings who only smile and have constant heartbeats."

*BOOM—!*

The rusted iron door finally gave way and collapsed with a thunderous crash.

Thick white mist poured in through the doorway, and with it came a group of figures like walking corpses.

Auntie Wang, Uncle Li, the tattooed man... and various unfamiliar faces. They held various "weapons"—rolling pins, clothes poles, even a still-dripping mop.

But this wasn't the most terrifying part.

The most terrifying part was that when they emerged from the mist and saw Lin Yi and Su Liang, their faces began to change.

Like clay being kneaded by invisible hands.

The "Auntie Wang" at the front—her features rapidly melted and reorganized. That originally plump face became angular, her gaze cold and sharp.

A few seconds later, she had become Lin Yi.

And not just her.

Uncle Li beside her became Su Liang.

The tattooed man behind also became Lin Yi.

Dozens of "Lin Yis" and "Su Liangs" stood on the rooftop, densely packed together. Their faces no longer bore the original kind smiles, but mimicked the expressions of the originals at this moment—cold, vigilant, even with a hint of mockery.

"Lin Yi..."

One of the "Lin Yis" spoke, his voice identical to Lin Yi's. "Why aren't you satisfied yet? Look, how perfect I am now. No pain, no debt, no suspicion..."

"Join us."

A "Su Liang" also spoke, extending her hand toward the real Su Liang. "We can be together forever, no need to calculate interest anymore, no need to worry about betrayal."

Dozens of voices overlapped, forming a sound wave with a hypnotic effect.

Su Liang's face turned deathly pale. Looking at those monsters wearing her face, she felt a physiological revulsion. The feeling was like looking in a mirror and suddenly seeing the reflection make an expression you'd never made.

"Don't look at their eyes!"

Lin Yi growled, grabbing Su Liang's shoulder and forcing her to turn around. "That's mental pollution! They're using visual signals to assimilate your self-perception! Once you start doubting 'which one is me,' you're finished!"

**[Warning: Mental value rapidly declining]**
**[Current mental value: 65/100]**

The visual impact was too strong. This wasn't just monsters—this was a negation of "existence" itself.

Lin Yi felt his brain trembling. For that instant, he even had a moment of confusion: *Maybe they're right? Maybe that version of me without pain is the better version?*

"Pain!"

Lin Yi suddenly pressed on his right arm wound. The intense pain instantly cleared his mind.

Pain. Only pain was the anchor that couldn't be simulated.

## Section 3: The Filthy Slide

"The path is blocked."

Su Liang leaned against the railing and glanced behind her. This was the fourth-floor rooftop; below was the hard concrete courtyard. Jumping down meant certain death. "Fight them?"

"Can't win. They're immortal unless we destroy the core."

Lin Yi's brain was racing.

Where was the core of this apartment? The fake people transmitted through mirrors and assimilated through vision. And the rule publisher of this entire building, the so-called "property management"...

Lin Yi suddenly remembered the duty room he'd seen in the first-floor lobby on the day he moved in. There was a huge monitoring display screen that occupied an entire wall.

All the mirrors, all the lines of sight, would ultimately converge there.

"Go to the first floor. Find that old lady manager." Lin Yi said.

"How do we get there? Fly down?" Su Liang looked at the advancing army of fake people. They had already formed a semicircle, forcing the two into a dead end.

Lin Yi's gaze frantically searched the rooftop, finally locking onto the huge garbage chute opening in the corner.

It was a rusted metal funnel, about sixty centimeters in diameter—just enough to fit a person. The chute opening emitted a nauseating stench, pitch black and bottomless.

In old-style apartments, this kind of chute led directly to the first-floor garbage room. And the garbage room was right next to the duty room.

"Take the 'elevator.'" Lin Yi pointed at the opening.

Su Liang followed his finger and her expression instantly changed.

"Are you insane?" She looked at the chute covered in grease and unknown viscous liquid. "There might be a shredder inside, or it could be full of that black slime. And this is too..."

Too disgusting. For a girl with a cleanliness obsession, this was worse than death.

"But right now, this is the only way."

Lin Yi didn't waste words.

The fake people had closed in to within five meters. One of the monsters wearing Lin Yi's face suddenly extended its arm like noodles, reaching for Lin Yi's neck.

*Swish!*

Though disgusted, Su Liang reacted extremely fast, swinging her blade to sever the tentacle. Black liquid sprayed out, making a *sizzle* of corrosion as it hit the ground.

"Damn it!"

Su Liang cursed. She knew there was no choice.

"Lin Yi, I'm adding this to your tab too! Mental distress fee!"

"Add it!"

Lin Yi hesitated no longer. He took a deep breath, wrapped his arms around his head, curled into a ball, and leaped directly into that filthy metal chute.

"Ah—"

Su Liang closed her eyes and, one second before being grabbed by the monsters, also jumped down.

## Section 4: The Mother's Womb

*Clang! Clang!*

His body violently collided and slid through the narrow metal chute.

In the darkness, Lin Yi felt like he'd been swallowed into a python's esophagus.

Slippery garbage bags, rotting food scraps, and some sticky liquid covered his entire body. The stench was no longer just a smell, but had become a tangible gas that shot straight to his skull, suffocating him.

Gravity accelerated his descent, each second stretched out.

"Please don't let there be a shredder..." Lin Yi prayed silently.

A few seconds later, the originally steep chute became gradual, and his speed slowed.

*Splash!*

Lin Yi felt himself fly out, then crash heavily onto a pile of soft, rotting things.

"Cough, cough, cough..."

He scrambled up awkwardly, his whole body in pain, feeling like his skeleton was about to fall apart. Ignoring the filth on his body, he immediately turned on his mini flashlight.

The beam illuminated the surroundings.

Su Liang slid out of the chute opening just then, landing on the garbage pile beside him. She dry-heaved a few times, her expression terrible.

"This is..."

Lin Yi looked around, his pupils contracting slightly.

This was indeed the garbage room, piled with trash from who knows how many years of this apartment's existence.

But unlike an ordinary garbage room, the walls here weren't covered with fungi or stains, but were covered with... mirror surfaces.

Countless small mirror fragments, like mosaics, covered all four walls, reflecting the flashlight's beam and making the entire room appear bizarre and distorted.

And in the center of the room was a half-open iron door with a sign hanging on it:

【Property Management Office (No Unauthorized Entry)】

Through the door crack seeped an eerie pink glow. The light seemed to breathe, flickering bright and dim.

Even more chilling was the sound.

An extremely grand, low humming sound came from behind that door.

*Hum... hum...*

"Listen."

Su Liang, ignoring the filth on her body, suddenly raised her hand, signaling Lin Yi to be quiet. She pressed her ear against the wall, her face turning deathly pale in the light and shadow.

"What is it?" Lin Yi lowered his voice.

"A heartbeat."

Su Liang turned her head to look at Lin Yi, her eyes showing unprecedented fear. "Behind the door... there's only one heartbeat."

"But that sound is too loud. So loud it's like... the entire building is beating along with it."

Lin Yi gripped the fruit knife in his hand—aside from the mirror shard, it was his only weapon.

He glanced at the wall full of mirror fragments. Those fragments reflected countless disheveled versions of himself. But at this moment, those reflections weren't moving; they just quietly watched Lin Yi, as if awaiting final judgment.

"Could this be the mother body?"

Lin Yi wiped the dirty water from his face, his gaze turning cold and sharp. "Let's see what the 'heart' of this 'perfect community' actually looks like."
