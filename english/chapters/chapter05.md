# Chapter 5: Survival Instinct

## Section 1: Think Like a Rat

The third time he opened his eyes.

Lin Yi didn't jump up like the first two times. He didn't check his body either.

He lay curled up in the dusty corner like a real corpse, arms wrapped tightly around his knees, body shaking violently.

His teeth chattered, making "clack clack" sounds.

The phantom pain of being torn apart, chewed up, and beaten to death was like a fog that wouldn't go away. It covered every inch of his nerves.

Even though he wasn't injured now, he felt like his whole body was in pain.

*Buzz.*

The system interface popped up again. The bright red countdown was like a death sentence: **29:58**.

"I can't do this... I really can't..."

Lin Yi buried his face in his knees. Tears flowed down uncontrollably, mixing with the dust on his face and turning into dirty mud.

"What stupid trial... what stupid rebirth... I'm just a college student... I want to go home..."

Fear.

Complete, overwhelming fear crushed all his pride.

The first two deaths made him understand a cruel fact: in front of those constantly evolving monsters, his proud "gaming skills" and "memory advantage" were as ridiculous as a baby's toy sword.

He only had 100 mental points. Now only 70 remained.

A few more deaths and he would be erased. Really disappear.

"I'm going to die... I'm really going to die here..."

Time passed second by second.

5 minutes went by.

Lin Yi still huddled in the corner, not daring to move a step.

Just then, a wind blew past, rolling up waste paper on the ground.

The paper tumbled, revealing a line of small text underneath—it was a piece of old newspaper on the classroom floor with half a blurry headline:

*"...to survive is the only truth..."*

Lin Yi stared at those words through his tears.

Survive.

"Victory condition: Survive 30 minutes."

This system message suddenly exploded in his mind.

Lin Yi's head shot up. His eyes showed confusion, then gradually turned into a kind of crazy clarity.

"Survive... yes, the mission is to survive!"

"The system never said to kill monsters! Never said to clear the map! Never said to find a safe room!"

His two previous deaths were because he treated himself as the "main character," as the "hunter." He actively looked for weapons, actively set traps, actively provoked those monsters.

This was typical **gamer thinking**—killing enemies gives experience, offense is the best defense.

"But in reality... in real wilderness survival, when facing predators many times stronger, what should the weak do?"

Lin Yi looked at the gray sky outside the window and muttered to himself.

"Antelopes don't attack lions. Mice don't provoke cats."

"They run. They hide. They hide themselves in the dirtiest, most inconspicuous corners. Even if they hold their breath until they suffocate, they survive."

To survive, you can't be a hero.

You have to be a rat.

You have to be the most humble, most sneaky, most inconspicuous rat in the gutter.

Lin Yi wiped away his tears. His eyes changed.

No longer that flashy confidence, and not complete breakdown either. Instead, it was... a beast-like alertness and humility.

He slowly stood up. The first thing he did was take off his sneakers.

The soles were soft, but in hallways full of gravel and glass shards, they would still make noise.

He wore only socks, stepping on the ice-cold cement floor. Glass shards stabbed his feet, but he gritted his teeth and didn't make a sound.

Then he looked at the fire axe.

It was a symbol of power, a source of security.

But he turned away without hesitation, not even looking at it again.

"Too heavy. Too loud. Carrying it, I'll have the idea to 'fight back.' And once I want to fight back, I'm close to death."

Lin Yi, barefoot, like a ghost, silently pressed against the wall and slipped out of the classroom.

## Section 2: Game in the Gutter

This time, Lin Yi didn't use the hallway.

He used collapsed walls and broken window frames between classrooms to move through the rooms.

Every time he passed a doorway, he would lie on the ground and press his ear to the floor for dozens of seconds. After confirming there was no movement outside, he would crawl across quickly like a gecko.

The red dots on the virtual map were moving.

The zombies were searching. They were evolving.

They were probably wondering why that arrogant prey didn't appear at the stairway this time. Why was there no sound?

"Keep looking... you won't find me."

Lin Yi crawled into a girls' bathroom.

This was forbidden territory in all horror games, but in Lin Yi's eyes, there was a perfect hiding place here—the ventilation duct.

He stood on the toilet lid and struggled to remove the louvers from the vent. The rusty screws cut his fingers. Blood seeped out.

Lin Yi immediately put his bleeding finger in his mouth and sucked hard, not letting the bloody smell spread.

Because he remembered that the zombies in the first mission had very sensitive smell.

He crawled into the narrow, dark duct full of dust and spider webs.

The space was extremely small, barely enough for one person to crawl. People with claustrophobia would go crazy here, but Lin Yi felt an unprecedented sense of security.

He put the louvers back and stared through the gaps at the bathroom below.

Time passed.

**15 minutes.**

A rush of messy footsteps charged into the bathroom.

Three zombies.

They held weapons and paced around the bathroom anxiously. They smelled a living person (probably from the blood Lin Yi spilled earlier), but couldn't find the source.

One zombie even lay on the ground, checking the gaps under the stall doors.

Another smashed the bathroom mirror with a steel pipe, venting its anger at not finding prey.

Lin Yi lay in the duct two meters above their heads. He even stopped breathing.

A spider crawled across his cheek. The fuzzy feeling made him itch like crazy, but he stayed still as a statue, not even blinking.

He counted silently in his mind.

*One second, two seconds, three seconds...*

The zombies found nothing and left with roars.

Only after the footsteps completely disappeared did Lin Yi let out a long breath. He was almost completely exhausted.

"This is survival..."

No fancy combos. No satisfying headshots.

Only enduring loneliness, fear, and filth in the darkness, surviving like an insect.

But this wasn't shameful. Because he was still alive.

**25 minutes.**

Lin Yi had to move.

The system seemed to be forcing him out by releasing a toxic green gas into the duct.

"Forcing me out?"

Lin Yi crawled out from the exit at the end of the third floor. This was the back of the school building.

At this moment, all the zombies in the campus seemed to riot. They lost patience and started a carpet search.

The hallways were full of roars. Red dots densely converged on the third floor.

"I'm surrounded."

Lin Yi looked at the terrain.

The only way out was through the window.

But outside the window was only a rusty cast iron drainpipe attached to the wall.

Below was cement ground more than ten meters high. Falling would mean certain death.

Behind him were zombies breaking through the door. Staying would mean certain death.

"I'll risk it!"

Lin Yi climbed out the window. His whole body hung in the air. His hands desperately hugged that rough pipe.

The rough rust instantly scraped the skin off his palms. Piercing pain came through.

"Hiss—"

Lin Yi gritted his teeth, not daring to make a sound.

He moved down bit by bit like a sloth.

Just then, a rotting head poked out from the window above.

A zombie found him!

It stretched out its thin arm, trying to grab Lin Yi's hair.

Its fingertips scraped past Lin Yi's scalp, pulling out a few strands of hair.

Lin Yi's heart stopped. If he let go now, he would be smashed to pulp.

But he didn't panic.

Because he discovered that although this zombie had evolved, it seemed afraid to climb this vertical pipe. It anxiously slapped the wall on the windowsill, helplessly raging.

"You're scared too?"

A hint of vengeful pleasure rose in Lin Yi's heart. He endured the severe pain and sped up his descent.

When he slid to the second floor, his arms were so sore they were losing feeling. His palms were covered in blood.

But he saw an open window on the second floor.

He took a deep breath, pushed off the wall with his feet, and swung.

His whole body flew toward that window like a pendulum.

*Bang!*

He crashed heavily into the second-floor storage room. In that instant, he felt like two of his ribs might have broken.

The severe pain made his vision go black, but he didn't even groan. He immediately crawled on all fours under a pile of abandoned desks and covered himself with some rags.

**29 minutes 30 seconds.**

Dense footsteps came from the stairs. The zombie horde was coming downstairs. They knew the prey was on the second floor.

The footsteps approached the storage room.

The door was smashed open.

The stench of rot spread.

A foot stopped in front of the desk where Lin Yi was hiding.

Through the gaps in the rags, Lin Yi could see those torn sneakers and the black sticky liquid dripping on the ground.

If it bent down.

If it lifted this cloth.

Everything would be over.

Lin Yi's eyes were wide open. His hand tightly gripped a piece of glass he'd found on the ground.

If discovered, he would stab the enemy's eye without hesitation—or stab his own carotid artery.

Compared to being bitten to death, suicide might be the last dignity.

"3..."

"2..."

"1..."

The countdown on Lin Yi's retina reached zero.

The moment the zombie bent down, a holy white light suddenly burst out and swallowed the entire world.
