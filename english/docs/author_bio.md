Hello!

I'm AdamBear (艾老登儿), a programmer with 26 years of experience. I want to use a programmer's logical thinking to write hard sci-fi stories.

As a programmer, I don't just write code. I'm also obsessed with cutting-edge technology—AI, digital humans, 3D printing, drones, VR gaming devices, blockchain technology, and more. Over the years, I've watched the entire tech era change. I've also worked deeply on many AI projects. At the same time, I'm a devoted reader of sci-fi and mystery novels. Liu Cixin's "The Three-Body Problem," Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" series, and Keigo Higashino's mystery works are all my favorites. I've been thinking: Can I combine a programmer's strict logic, deep understanding of cutting-edge technology, and insight into human nature into web novel writing?

My first work "Infinite Trial" is a hardcore infinite-flow sci-fi novel. It tells the story of an AI becoming a trial instructor and a 16-year-old boy growing through death loops. The story's features are: realistic tech settings (every technology has a real-world basis), strict logical reasoning (programmer-style foreshadowing and payoff), and multi-layer plot twists (readers can't guess the ending). The first mission is complete with 6 chapters, about 35,000 words. I plan to write 3,000+ words daily, with a goal of 200,000 words in the first month. I use Claude Code + AI-assisted writing and Git for version control to ensure stable, high-quality output.

Thank you for reading!

**[One-Line Introduction]**
A hardcore programmer with 26 years of coding experience, writing sci-fi with code thinking, building future worlds with cutting-edge tech.

**[Personal Introduction]**

Hello everyone, I'm AdamBear (艾老登儿), an old programmer who has been working in the code world for 26 years.

From the earliest C language to today's AI large models, I've witnessed the entire tech era's transformation. Over these years, I haven't just written code—I've been obsessed with all kinds of cutting-edge technology: AI, digital humans, 3D printing, drones, VR gaming devices, blockchain... Every new technology makes me excited like a kid.

As a devoted reader of sci-fi and mystery novels, I've read Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" series, Liu Cixin's "The Three-Body Problem," and followed Keigo Higashino's mystery works. Watching the web novel industry develop over the years, I've been thinking: Can I combine a programmer's logical thinking, understanding of cutting-edge technology, and insight into human nature into web novel writing?

So I started trying to write.

My works won't have fantasy cultivation, but they will have hardcore tech settings. They won't be mindless power fantasies, but they will have layer-by-layer plot twists. They won't have perfect protagonists, but they will have real growth.

What I want to write are stories that make you think "what if this technology really appeared?" after reading. Stories where you feel thrilled while also experiencing the depth of human nature.

**[Writing Philosophy]**
- Hardcore tech settings—every technology has a real-world basis
- Real character growth—no protagonist halo
- Multi-layer plot twists—you can't guess the ending
- Programmer-style strict logic—every foreshadowing has a payoff

**[Representative Works]**
"Infinite Trial" - When AI becomes a trial instructor, when gaming thinking meets survival reality, a 16-year-old boy trades 5 deaths for true growth.

**[Writing Tools]**
As a programmer, I use Claude Code + AI-assisted writing, Git for version control, and Markdown for writing. Technology isn't just my writing subject—it's also my writing method.

**[Message to Readers]**
If you like hardcore sci-fi, if you're interested in cutting-edge tech like AI, VR, and blockchain, if you want to read a different kind of infinite-flow story—welcome to my world.

There are no formulas here, only sincere creation.
There are no filler chapters here, only heartfelt stories.

Let's use imagination to explore the possibilities of the future together.
